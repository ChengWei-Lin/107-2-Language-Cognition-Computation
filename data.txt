black arrow thank you iowa now were just heard from president obama reminded me of something that i think we should think about and that is to reach child to our republican friends and colleagues who are suffering from a very very serious illness they suffer from amnesia that people of month were losing their drops day for cox that the worlds financial system was on the verge of collapse and theyve just four cocks that we were out all the largest deficit in the history of the united states and the last year of george bush so we wear our republican friends well on the road to recovery and we tell them what every american knows yeah we got problems today but everybody knows thanks to the president and the vice president we have made real progress in improving our economy and we have to spy on precedent obstructionism from right wing republican since all of you look great work is chair of the iowa democratic party our country and for doing today what few americans are doing on knox complaining you are not turning our backs on the political process and fighting back campaign and the political revolution when you see the middle class of this country disappearing and when you see people you know what three jobs trying to cobble together some incumbents home health care of your dog josh shoulders and say thats the way it is turn raise the minimum wage dollars and we fight for women workers when millions of americans today do not have jobs due friday for a massive federal jobs program to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and millions of our people back to work you fight for an economy that works for all americans and not just the wealthiest people in this country when you see when you use that the united states has more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth and when you see all of the new income being generated today is going to the top you know you know and the american people know that that is not borrow not sustain and you demand that the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations start paying their fair share of taxes that here in the united states we have more people in jail than any other country on earth disproportionately black and latino that what we have talked to do and educate should not more channels and across her ex when you saw the united states supreme court of one of the worst in the history of our country past the citizens united case wealthiest people in this country who are sexually by elections and by candidates demanded a constitutional amendment turn and i promise that no nominee to the supreme court will be voting to support citizens united now while many in the republican party continued to deny the reality of climate change that we live in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and you understand the moral imperative moral imperative that wed leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our children and our grandchildren you are not on the sidelines of these struggles you are in the middle of this fight and that is what our campaign is all about when i began president of the united states of america and when we announced going to take on the political and economic establishment of this country very few people knew who i was not the fact i may have a big black we worried about of the polls we had no money we had no political organization while in the last six months yes hundreds of thousands of volunteers and every state in this country are working hard including right here in iowa americans and withdrawing some of the largest turnouts of any campaign and today i can tell you and im very proud of this that we have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of our country at this point now the fun begins the great political experts in this campaign unless you have a superpower unless unless you go to the million billion has the money democratic candidate for president who does not have a super pac and we are gonna prove the experts in this campaign and by the way just to remember about eight years ago all of the political experts talked about how another democratic candidate for president just couldnt win he was its president well iowa i think we are going to prove the product its wrong i believe weve got one more time now i my political life is well known as some other candidates and the remaining time but i have to talk to you about some of the difficult choices decisions that i have had to make some of the forks in the road that i have encountered in my career as mayor of burlington commodity us congressman and as a united states certainly when i was elected mayor of the largest city in my state by votes i think its fair to say that it was a shock to the establishment nobody thought we could win that election and i was opposed by the entire political establishment thats the way was i faced a fork in the road to the special interests in my city and the political establishment always stand up and fight back and that is what we did we doubled the voter turnout we elected candidates and we made profound changes to make her lick one of the united states of america and i learned the lesson and then left with the people to take on big money ordinary people will get involved in the political process they will come out and vote and thats a lesson we learn today republicans when wet voter turnout is low we win out at voter turnout is high now after i came to congress elected in nineteen ninety corporate america wall street the administration and virtually all of the corporate video they said you gotta vote for this nafta trade agreement break i didnt believe their audience i voted against nafta i voted against capital i voted against me with china and history has proven those of us who oppose those agreements were right because in the last years this country has lost sixty thousand factories and millions of jobs and let me be clear about the current trade deal that we are debating in congress the transpacific partnership agreement is not now nor has the gold standard of trade agreements i did not support it yesterday i do not support it and i will in nineteen my face another fork in the road a very very difficult political situation it was called the defense of marriage act brought forth by republican led congress and its purpose was clear to discriminate against gays and lesbians and the law gay and lesbian rights were not popular then im sorry to have to tell you that that bill won by an overwhelming majority in the house of three hundred and forty to fifty seven that was not a political easy now today summer trying to rewrite history by saying they voted for one antigay law to stop something worse thats not the case there was a small minority in the house oppose the discriminating against our gay brothers and i am proud then i was one of those baptists climate change climate change is real climate change is caused by human activity and climate change is already causing devastating damage in america is all over the world in american history when almost all republicans running for president reject science and the need for bold action to combat climate change these republicans prefer to take super pac contributions from the koch brothers at the fossil fuel industry rather than to protect the planet for our kids and our grandchildren and if you agree with me about the urgent need to address climate change then you know immediately what to do about the keystone pipeline this was not a complicated should we support the construction of a pipeline across america accelerating the extraction and transportation of some of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world to me and thats why i have a proposed pipeline let me take you back to a very eventful year and a decision in the modern history of our country the years and true the issue is whether congress should vote to invade iraq public opinion and most of the video while for the wall and it turns out that big majorities in congress or for all the war as well overwhelming support in the house and the senate for the walk i listen to what bush and cheney and rumsfeld and i said no theyre not theyre true and i was right riders joy predicted about iraq turned out to be right at all but that was a tough vote i came to that fork in the road and i took the right road even though it was not popular at that time while congress i opposed it time and time again to rein in wall straight to fail to reestablish and bring back to last season and we need to break up these huge facts here are just saying this we as a nation enormously difficult and complex problems thats the truth but i believe now and i have always believed from the bottom of my heart that yes these guys got the money they have the power but when people stand black and white hispanic straight young men and women game when we stand there is nothing that we cannot accomplish and i pledge to you that every day i will fight for the public interest not the corporate interests of american society where the ok what black or latino full working class just be cause politically expedient at a given the republicans that their reactionary agenda for the billion but not for ordinary americans and we are going to defeat down thank you all very muchthank you iowa thank you nine months ago we came to this beautiful state we had no political organization we had no money no name recognition and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the united states of america and tonight while the results are still not known it looks like we are in a virtual tie and while the results are still not complete it looks like well have half of the iowa delegates i want to take this opportunity to congratulate secretary clinton somebody yep and her organization for waging a very vigorous campaign and i want to thank governor omalley its never easy to lose ive lost more than one campaign but he should know that he contributed a whole lot to the dialogue that he ran an issueoriented campaign and he won the respect of the american people if i think about what happened tonight i think the people of iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment to the economic establishment and by the way to the media establishment given the enormous crises facing our country it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics what the american people have said — and by the way i hear this not just from progressives i hear it from conservatives i hear it from moderates — that is we can no longer continue to have a corrupt campaign finance system i am the former chairman of the senate veterans committee in that capacity not only have i worked hard to try to protect the interest of our veterans ive had the privilege of meeting so many men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us and protect our way of life and what they were protecting is an american democracy of one person one vote not billionaires buying elections i am overwhelmed and i am moved by the fact that millions of people throughout this country have helped volunteer in our campaign that three we have received in this campaign million individual contributions people who went to berniesanderscom and you know what the average contribution was it was ! we do not represent the interests of the billionaire class wall street or corporate america we dont want their money we will and i am very proud to tell you we are the only candidate on the democratic side without a super pac and the reason that we have done so well here in iowa the reason i believe were going to do so well in new hampshire and in the other states that follow the reason is the american people are saying no to a rigged economy they no longer want to see an economy in which the average american works longer hours for low wages while almost all new income and wealth is going to the top what the american people understand is this country was based and is based on fairness it is not fair when the top /th of today owns almost as much wealth as the bottom it is not fair when the wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of america so you guys ready for a radical idea well so is america and that radical idea is we are going to create an economy that works for working families not just the billionaire class and when millions of our people are working for starvation wages we are going to raise the minimum wage to an hour and yes we are going to have pay equity for women ive been all over this state of iowa we have spoken to some people and in meeting after meeting i hear people standing up and they say bernie i went to college i graduated college — now i am thousand dollars in debt that is crazy that is crazy they want to get a decent education they should not be punished that is why i believe in the year public colleges and universities should be tuition free and then my critics say well bernie thats a great idea all this free stuff how are you going to pay for it i will tell you how we will pay for it we are going to impose a tax on wall street speculation the greed the recklessness and the illegal behavior of wall street drove this economy to its knees the american people bailed out wall street now its wall streets time to help the middle class and when we talk about transforming america we will end the disgrace of having more people in jail than any other country disproportionately africanamerican and latino what we are going to do is provide jobs and education for our kids not more jails and incarceration ill tell you something that really does astound me im on the senate energy committee — on the senate environmental committee — i have talked to scientists all over the world the debate is over climate change is real and we have a moral responsibility to work with countries throughout the world to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy what amazes me what totally amazes me is that we have not one republican candidate for president prepared to come up and tell us and agree with what virtually all scientists agree with and you know why they are not prepared to do that because on the day that they do acknowledge the reality of climate change and call for change you know what happens theyre going to lose their campaign funds from the koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry so i say to the republicans stop worrying about your campaign funds from big oil or the koch brothers worry about the planet youre going to be leaving your children and your grandchildren now i have been criticized during this campaign for many many things every single day thats okay thats okay but let me repeat what i believe i believe that at a time when every major country on earth guarantees health care to all people as a right that i believe that we should do the same in the united states of america so for all of my critics out there in the wall street journal and the washington post and in corporate america wherever you may be let me tell you straight up yes i believe that health care is a right not a privilege! and that is why i believe in a medicare for all single payer program which will not only guarantee health care to all it will not only end the pharmaceutical ripoff of the american people but it will save the middle class family the average middleclass family thousands of dollars a year in health care costs let me conclude by saying what no other candidate for president will tell you and that is that no president not bernie sanders not anybody else will be able to bring about the changes that the working families and the middle class of this country that our children that the seniors our seniors deserve no one president can do it because the powers that be wall street with their endless supply of money corporate america the large campaign donors are so powerful that no president can do what has to be done alone and that is why and that is why what iowa has begun tonight is a political revolution a political revolution that says when millions of people come together including those whove given up on the political process theyre so dismayed and so frustrated with what goes on in washington with young people who before had never been involved in the political process when young people and working people and seniors begin to stand up and say loudly and clearly enough is enough that our government the government of our great country belongs to all of us and not just a handful of billionaires when that happens we will transform this country thank you all very muchclose relations i thank her for her call and i congratulate her and her supporters with a vigorous campaign to thank the many many thousands of volunteers here in the granite state made phone calls and knocked on a heck of a lot of doors energy thank you all great campaign we have sent the message that will echo from wall street to washington from maine to california the government of our great country belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors and theyre super pacs months ago we began our campaign here in new hampshire we had no campaign organization we had no money and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the united states of america with what appears to be a recordbreaking voter turnout and are safe august energy and the excitement that the democratic party will need to succeed in november in terms of an enthusiastic and arrivals electorate people came out in large numbers that is what will happen all over democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low we serve notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the american people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finances and we will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary americans work for low wages while only in commonwealth goes to the top one percent take this opportunity to congratulate secretary clinton and her organization its supporters who waging a vigorous campaign i hope that in the days ahead we can continue to wage a strong issueoriented campaign and bring we all remember and this is a message not just to our opponents but to those who support me as well that we will need to come together in a few months and unite this party and their slaves shouldnt because the right wing republicans we oppose must not be allowed to gain the president remember the last time republicans occupied the white house their trickledown economic policies drove us into the worst economic downturn since the depression of the nineteen thirties though we will not allow huge tax breaks for billionaires packed huge cuts to social security federal medicare medicaid and education back into the white house a political party which is sold the whole to the fossil fuel industry that they cannot even acknowledge the scientific reality of climate change hampshire have sent a profound message to the political establishment economic establishment and by the way to the media establishment same old establishment politics and establishment economics people want real change i hear this not just for progressives but for conservatives and moderates is that we can no longer continue to have a campaign finance system in which wall street and the billionaire class are able to buy elections political view maybe understand that that is not what democracy is about that is what im talking about we will allow them to continue and i do not want a superclass overwhelms i am deeply moved from more than i can express in words by the fact that our campaigns financial support comes from more than one million americans have made more than three point seven million individual contributions than any candidate in the history of the united states up until this point it election average contribution was seven going tonight city to hold a fundraiser on wall street im going to hold a fundraiser right here right now across america please go to bernie sanders dot com and contribute raise the funds we need whether its bucks or twenty bucks or bucks how was raised the money we need to take the fight to south carolina and the stakes pretty quick american people understand is that our great country was based on a simple principle and that principle various let me be very clear it is not fair when we have more income and wealth inequality today that almost any major country on earth and when the top onetenth of one percent now almost as much well as the bottom thats not so wealthiest people in this country now own more wealth than the bottom half of the american people ready for a radical idea and economy and when they should wages weve got a raise yes we are going to make public colleges and universities of americans struggling with horrendous levels of student debt we are going to substantially ease the burden people should not be financially distressed for decades for the crime the crime of trying to get higher education thats absurd my critics say you know bernie is a great idea until all this free stuff how youre going to pay for it i will tell you how it go to pay for it going to impose a tax on wall street speculation recklessly and the illegal behavior of wall street our own economy two weeks ds the american people bailed out wall street now its wall streets time to help the middle class america it means ending the disgrace of this country having more people in jail than any other country in the world disproportionately africanamerican and latino are we going to fight and institutional racism and a broken criminal justice jobs and education for our young people not journals and incarceration is a member of the energy committee in the senate and the environmental committee the debate is over climate change is real and it is already causing devastating problems in this country and around the world we have a moral responsibility to work with countries throughout the world to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy criticized during this campaign for many many things every single day thats ok its alright throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink and i have the feeling that kitchen see is coming pretty soon as well is thinking big not small its about having the courage to reject the status quo when every major country on earth guarantees healthcare to all of their people we should be doing the same in our great country president obamas leadership the affordable care act has been an important step forward no question about it but we can and must do that and even greater with large deductibles and copayments we should not be paying by fall the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs at a time listen to this when the top three drug companies in this country made billion dollars in profit last year and let me tell you something when we make it to the white house pharmaceutical industry will continue to report we continue to spend far from capitol then do the people of any other nation all of whom guarantee health care to all of the people and that is why i believe in a medicare for all singlepayer program but will save the average middleclass family thousands of dollars a year in health care costs friends we all know that we live in a dangerous and complex world as president i will defend this nation but i will do it responsibly i voted against the war in iraq go right votes combating terrorists who would do us home we cannot and should not be the policeman of the world should we bear the burden of fighting terrorism alone in the middle east united states must be part of an international coalition sustained by nations in the region there have the means to protect themselves together we must it will destroy isis what we should do it in a way that does not good our young men and women in the military into perpetual warfare in the quiet fix our broken immigration system that divides families and create a path toward citizenship hardworking people and thats received so that people can live in dignity crumbling infrastructure and when we do that we create millions of decent paying jobs pursue the fight for womens rights for gay rights for disability rights stronger and stronger opposition protect the right of a woman to control our own body protect the men and women who serve our nation in uniform and protect our veterans to defend we must tell the billionaire class in the that they cannot have it all at a time of massive wealth and income inequality the wealthiest people and largest corporations in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes i am the son of a polish immigrants came to this country speaking no english and having no money my father worked every day of his life a whole lot my mom and dad and brother i grew up in a small three and a half room rentcontrolled apartment in brooklyn new york always dream of moving out of that apartment getting a home of our own but you never realize the truth is that neither one of my parents could ever dream would be here tonight standing before you as a candidate for president of the united states and this is the promise we must keep alive for future generations what began last week along with voters here in new hampshire confirm tonight is nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution of our people together it will bring together working people given up on the political process it will bring young people in the political process he knows asian americans native americans female and people who immigrated here and clearly that the government of our songs to all of us not just a few wealthy campaign contributors this campaign is about that is what the political revolution is about solo hampshire thank you again and now its odd south carolina up fbilives this afternoon political revolution contributed campaign raises money at a time around some rich persons dining room living room where people are putting in a hundred thousand dollars into a super pac this is a peoples meeting at the only nine billion major candidate who does not have a super pac i do not represent the agenda of the billionaire class or corporate america i dont want to i dont need their money is about is just what were doing right now last night just to give you an example we had some house bodies all over america i am told told the la with people are all over the country we had people coming out over people need individual contributions averaging apiece a result of last nights debate i am told that we have raised two million what i raised right now there are many londons who believe that the only way a candidate to run a successful campaign to have a super pac down on ones needs before the millionaires and billionaires big damper money and what we are showing years we can run a peopleoriented campaign funded by the pool country we had a great rally here a few months ago and i like in a sense the god knows how many thousands of people one guy came up to me you know what i like about what youre doing is youre treating us as if we were intelligent human beings campaign is about about demanding that all of us and the media start talking about the real issues facing this time i slipped on a banana peel leaving here with me in the front page but when we talk about the great crises facing this country to get media attention for a lot of obvious reasons and if i was standing here tonight and making some vicious attack against hillary clinton or anybody else about why the middle class is disappearing and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top one percent not a big story so what the political revolution is is forcing a debate not about trivial but about the real issues country faces serious different people have different ideas but i think they are tired of seeing politics looked at it as if it were a baseball game or a soap opera on the world but on some of the major issues i think as the nation we have got right now in this country we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth and it is worse today than at any time since the late nineteen twenties do we find it morally or economically acceptable on tv but are one tenth of one percent one tenth of one percent owns almost as much well as the bottom la california and vermont all over this country we all know people who are working incredibly long hours in fact i dont know how many of you know this we americans work the longest hours of any other industrialized country people are working week the working two jobs and three journals and yet percent of all income generated in this country is going to the top one percent for a while we are talking about an economy that is rich and let me give you an example of what you got people all over la they worked in for really low wages and yet in the last two years alone wealthiest people in this country were ready zillionaires fifteen people saw their wealth increase by over a hundred and fifty billion dollars fifteen people that is more well that is owned by the bottom hundred and thirty million americans so what you have right now is a rigged economy by which the rich get richer everybody else gets we have got to create an economy in america and we can which works for working families not just billionaire tragedy that we have got to address which is pretty much not talked about by politicians or the media and that is number one real unemployment which means people who have given up looking for work and millions of people working part time when they want to work full time when you add all that together unemployed box on the one who work fulltime people given up looking for work real unemployment in this country and then let me tell you something which is never discussed and that is the tragedy of youth unemployment in america real unemployment and underemployment years for kids between and are high school graduates then drop out of high school graduates and this is what they said white kids the number is kids the number is for african american young people the number is we dont talk about this issue and thats why last night i said i am tired of hillarys emails lets talk about reelection what does when millions of young people disproportionately latino and africanamerican im not in school and what it means is a five and a half million of them for burlington vermont so los angeles california i hanging out on street corners and attempted to get into trouble and the result of that in my view contributes to the fact that we in america have more people in jail than any other country on earth including china point two million people are in jail today and it cost to taxpayers eighty billion dollars a year families are being torn apart were spending huge sums of taxpayer money locked in people now it seems to be that it makes a lot more sense for us to be investing in education and jobs rather than jails lot less expensive for us to send young people to the university of california to lock them up another issue all of these issues are interconnected one of the things you learn you know when is the interconnectedness of all of these issues heres another reason why write it and that right now we have hundreds of thousands of bright young people in this country who have done well in schools were qualified they can not get a college education for one reason and that is their families lack the funds raised it is unfair to those young people to say youre never gonna make it into the middle class youre never gonna be a doctor or a scientist or engineer or a nurse you never gonna be able to do that because you cant afford to go to college that is unfair but what is even crazier is that as a nation we need to type all of the intellectual capability that weekend why i have introduced legislation which will implement as president to make every public college and university in america tuition free opponents think this is a real far ill radical idea its really not right fifty years ago fifty years ago if you were able to graduate high school the likelihood was that you will be able to go out and get a pretty good job today a college degree is the equivalent of what i high school degree was fifty years ago had public education in this country for way longer than a hundred years it is time now to include colleges as part of free public education and our legislation also addresses the crisis of millions of people struggling with very very high student debt pretty simple why should you if you have student debt be paying six eight percent interest rates when you can refinance your home but two or three percent people to refinance and get the government out of profiteering also working class making public colleges and universities tuitionfree why this is a revolutionary idea is not just because it makes life easier obviously for those people who go to college but it does something else even more important to a kid in the fifth grade grade in la or in burlington vermont that no matter what the income of your family is and i grew up in a family that never had a lot of money but no matter what your income is if you study hard if you take school seriously if you do well you will be able to get a college education billion dollars on wall street the recklessness and illegal behavior on wall street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in modern history wall street came rolling to the middle class of this country and they said louise bail us out i voted against the way but now that we are seeing ceos wall street make a new compensation packages it is their time to bail out the middle class you know its a funny thing somebody just yell out its jail time to it is it is an interesting statement on our very broken criminal justice system which has more people in jail than any other country but not as ceos over wall street people who sold marijuana in jail without people have destroyed the american economy about major issues facing our country and im just taking off some of them afternoon there is one issue that impacts every other issue and died as a result of the supreme courts decision in citizens united finance system is now corrupt and it is undermining the foundations of american democracy and thats just the simple truth where every spring there all week old town meetings people come together argue about how much theyre going to spend on the schools and on the roads and their budgets and all that stuff everybodys things off they argue one vote we are now living under a campaign finance system where you have one vote the koch brothers have one vote each plus nine hundred million dollars to buy canada days why i promise you that any nominee of mind to the united states supreme court will make it loud and clear that he or she will be voting to overturn that i am passionate believer in a very radical concept called democracy in human history accuracy is a pretty new one hundred years old and yet what we are seeing right now is a result of citizens united is a situation where the koch brothers alone will be spending more money in this campaign cycle of the democratic or republican politics when you got one family spending more money than either of the two major political parties youre not talking about democracy youre talking about a lunch date weve got a one of the day win when turnout so low they win when they can suppress the vote of people of color of lowincome people old people young people so not only do we have to frontally take on voter suppression and what i will do is president used to make it very clear that in states in this country if somebody is years of age that person is registered to vote and discuss public funding of elections and the reason i say that the reason i say that is your gonna do that too just yelled out of getting a lot of help you guys are helping me write my speeches i appreciate that young lady has said if we are serious about democracy when we give the american people the day off and make international democracy i want i want anybody who is interested in public service whether theyre conservative progressive moderate whatever i want them to be able to say you know what im gonna run for office and i want them to be able to run for office without having to big wealthy people for campaign contributions setters already a lot about another issue of enormous consequence is our moral responsibility frances recently reminded of this of this moral responsibility to leave this planet in a way that is healthy inhabitable for our kids and our grandchildren there is no longer a debate the scientific community is virtually unanimous climate change is real it is caused by human activity is already causing devastating problems in our country and all over the world thats the bad news heres the good news is if we are aggressive is we understand the enormity of this problem if we lead the world and work with russia and china and india and other countries we can transform our energy system globally away from fossil fuel energy efficiency and sustainable when we talk about our economy what this campaign is saying to the billionaire class is something that is pretty simple and that is they cannot continue to have it all their greed is destroying this nation and if i have anything to say about it and i truly will as president of the united states in the wealthiest people in this country will finally start paying their fair share of taxes everybody knows that we have in this country today million undocumented people now what has disturbed me very very much we have a number of republican candidates are not only done addressing the real issue of immigration reform they are scooping to racist attacks against the latino community we have been fighting against racism for hundreds of views on immigration but it is not acceptable to stoop to racist attacks against the mexican people when a person in this country is undocumented when a person in this country has no legal rights that person is very often exploited and that person worker cannot stand up for his or her rights so windows workers are exploited denied fair wages and benefits it not only impacts them it impacts every worker in america and leads us to a race to the bottom i believe that we need to provide legal status to all people who are undocumented as soon as possible and what remains in my heart i had a couple of months ago his own in phoenix and after a rally but we had a number of young latino girls teenagers came up to me and there were tears coming out of their cheeks down their cheeks as they express their fear the day or their parents could be our job is to unite families not to divide families is to go forward with comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship the republicans refuse to cooperate ill job is the house for president who will use the power of executive orders immigration reform we have got to the nation deal with institutional racism at a broken criminal justice system very very very long time african americans have been arrested and killed during the arrest process they have been killed while in custody and the system has allowed police departments to get away with that but with the rise of this when the american people see a video of people like sondra bland and many others what the american people are saying this is not acceptable burlington vermont three years will come here in the winter i work very closely with the police department which drew a burlington is true of police departments all of this country that is most cops work really hard theyre honest it is a very difficult job also any police officer as well as any public official and that police officer breaks he must be held accountable police talk about criminal justice i think all of us on the slim that there is something profoundly wrong in a nation when we see it seems god knows every week every month another mass killing and what about a person who walks into an elementary school in kills children whats another individual water and the whitchurch goes on to a bible study class and then kills nine people because the color of their skin is different than yours clearly what we need to do in my view is create a consensus a consensus which i believe exists in this country was sensible gun control legislation everything those guns to make sure they are able to get the help they need when they need closed in my office and i am sure that governors and senator dole the senators and members of congress public officials over america medical schools and so you know im worried about my brother i dont know what hes going to do to himself was somebody else and we desperately looking out for help and we cant find anything now that we can afford and then we see what that inaction means when we look at the front page of the newspaper and see you know the mass killing and another tragedy so in my view what we should absolutely make certain is that when people need counseling and they need mental health treatment they get it when they needed not too much where we are as a nation you read in the media tells you that we are very divided nation and to some degree thats true the differences of opinion on issues like gay marriage or abortion guns there is a real delight in this country quality huge issues but on the other hand what i want to tell you is there is a lot more commonality a lot more common interest among people then many would be able to believe the ranking member on the budget committee representing the democrats and here is what the republican budget is about the republican budget i want you to be thinking for a moment these are the guys who control the house and the usa and this is what their budget is and if you think im exaggerating and kidding you know go to the internet and check it out this is the truth this is why i say that because its hard to believe what the republican budget says is let us and the affordable care act make massive cuts in medicaid and throat million people without health insurance now we are the only major country under the doesnt guarantee healthcare people something i want to change and republicans want to throw twenty seven million people and when you ask the ranking member i said call me if you gonna throw twenty seven million people without health insurance how many thousands will become much thicker than they should have been they have no response at all there are and then you go on to another issue publicans well at a time when it is harder and harder for workingclass families to send their kids to college lets cut pell grants line billion dollars over ten year period lets make it even harder and by the way when families here in los angeles city vermont are struggling to put food on the table thats billions of dollars in cuts in nutrition programs and by the way after cutting health care and nutrition and environmental programs they have another brilliant idea and that is why dont we provide over two hundred and fifty billion dollars in tax breaks to be us two tenths of one percent because when the american people understand that and the media doesnt report the store but when the american people understand that they say these kinds of crazy world of the living it get away with that because in the last election sixtythree percent of the american people did in boats eighty percent of young people didnt vote and there are millions of people who know very very little about what goes on in washington millions of people dont even know which political party controls the usa house of the us senate know its a fact we are trying to do in this campaign and what i mean by waging a political revolution is to bring people together to stand up and demand that the united states government represents all of us and not just a handful of never comes from the top down it always comes from the bottom people struggle to build the trade union movement so that workers could engage in collective bargaining and earn decent wages and benefits millions of africanamericans in their white house lawyers and hispanic outlines an american allies fought to end racist legislation in this country but finally millions of people came together to be president notwithstanding the color of his skin well women struggle in said sorry we are not going to be secondclass citizens in america going to be able to control our own bodies allies struggled to make that happen a very long time ago somebody jumped up and said you know i think gay marriage should be legal in every state in america somebody would have told them theyre crazy couldnt have to fight what happened is the gay community in their street allies said you know what we are going to end homophobia in this country that real change can happen when we do not allow them to divide by the color of our skin by whether we are gay or straight white whether we were born in america or not in america whether were a woman or a man when we stand united fighting for our kids and our parents by the millions making this political revolution there is nothing nothing we cannot accomplishold larger say but you know super pacs are in my mind undermined american democracy and i wanted to not just talk the talk walk the walk so i said ok when i can do a super pac raise money all of you know just watching them run for national office so we saw actually reached out to working families in the middle class of this country possibly an amazing thing happened that i never dreamed would have had and that as as of today we have received two and a half million individual contributions more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of the united states bush drug companies change in this country and you can do it with the support of the middle class of this country that is what were trying to do it a pretty proud of them know whats also happened as you know when we started this campaign i think the first national polls how to say something like three percent but over the last of those numbers have gone up and they brought up here or you know i when i gotta tell you youre beautiful state we are seeing just extraordinary level of enthusiasm energy of support as of today one of the reasons i think we have an excellent chance to win here is that s up today we will have had meetings like this and lodging meetings where some i have come out to discuss the important issues facing this country in this campaign as of today by the end of this campaign year and i what i think will probably talking to people just like you want american democracy and thats pretty good so we have a lot of people many thousands of all he is talking to people making phone calls and i think thats why were going to win this oldfashioned way person to person now i think also one of the reasons we have been successful in this campaign because we are talking about the very very serious issues facing the american people and a lot of politics in america especially because of the media does not allow for serious discussion from a media perspective what politics is about its a soak up what happened if the person persons personal life holes its money its all kinds of things but its not really the issues impacting the american people in a democratic society what politics should be about his whats going on in the country whats wrong how we come together to change how we thought thats kind of what politics should be about not ripping apart everybody doing on the best in the world dummies and terrible people so lets talk about some of the important issues facing this country and at the top of my list are probably more and more people i think of discussing this issue is the issue of the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this country today we have the top one tenth of one percent only almost as much well as the bottle how do we feel how we feel about wealthiest people in this country only more well fifty percent of the american people welcome you to reflect upon think about you have one family in america owning more wealth than the bottom forty percent of the emergence turns out that the walton family is the major recipient of welfare country many people in this country because they are paying their workers wages that are so low and benefits that are so bad that many of their workers are on food stamps many of their workers are on medicaid and many other workers are in subsidized housing so generous and kind people in the middle class are helping to subsidize the wealthiest family in america and they very much appreciate you have come up to help their employees but you know ive got a radical idea maybe they should pay it and he said is that we are saying in my state and in your people working incredibly long hours trying to bring in enough income and health care to sustain their not uncommon for people to be working two or three jobs i suspect the juniors well not uncommon for mom to be working down to be working turns out that our people are working longer hours of any people in the industrialized world japanese worker long as we look and yet all of the hard work of the american people it turns out that percent of all new income generated in this country goes to the top one percent but that working incredible hours percent goes to the top one percent so what we are living in what this campaign is addressing is the fact that we have a rigged economy a rigged economy and unfair economy that despite how hard ordinary people working and going to the top one percent so what this campaign is about you suggesting a very radical of you want a radical idea is a radical idea what about an economy that works for the middle class and not just a handful of billionaires and maintained by a corrupt campaign finance system ever since the supreme court by a fivetofour decision voted for citizens united what that decision said to the wealthiest people in this country is you guys already own much of the american economy now even give you the opportunity to buy the united states government now the former chairman of the committee on veterans affairs on a river during hard we can talk about that later but i talked to veterans from world war two career was it really breaks my heart to see that people put their lives on the line to defend american democracy and now you have a handful of billionaires literally able to buy elections in this country you have one example something over here and i will usually he was the first caucus in the country there was a court has held several months ago by a gentleman named sheldon adelson you know heres a multi billionaire who contributes very heavily and what it did several months ago in the adelson corpus is invited leading republican candidates to come before him to tell him walk they would do a multibillionaire if they were elected president and one of them will end up getting his nomination and will be the recipient of tens of millions of dollars or maybe hundreds of stalls bottom line is when you have the koch brothers and a few of their friends prepared to spend nine hundred million dollars on this campus when sheldon adelson has his own caucus is not democracy that is call oligarchy and together we have got to change that now when we talk about the economy its important to talk about jobs every month federal government comes out of a series of reports on unemployment sorts but one that appears on the front pages of the papers is official employment official unofficial us official report tells us that official unemployment today is five percent believe that unemployment workers truth is theres another and the other report which doesnt get as much attention tells us that if you include people who have given up looking for work and people who are working part time when they wont work full time real unemployment is close to about on top of that there is the real crisis that very few people talk about regarding youth unemployment had a study done to me a few months ago this is what they say for high school graduates not dropouts my kids terms of unemployment and underemployment percent between the ages of and latino kids percent africanamerican kids now if anybody in this room doesnt see the correlation between high rates of youth unemployment and the fact that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth you would be missing a very important so here is another very radical idea second radical idea of the day and no one is fleeing the oil instead of investing in jails in incarceration for our kids what about investing in jobs and education and there is more than enough work to be done in this country we have an infrastructure roads bridges rail system wastewater plants watered that in many parts of this country literally grown and thats why i have called for a one trillion dollar investment one trillion dollar investment what thirteen million people back to work making our country more efficient and safe lets rebuild our infrastructure the reason that sometimes a phd in economics to figure out that the reason as to why people are working such long hours has everything to do with the fact that wages are you can do the arithmetic as well as i can but somebody who works for eight bucks an hour a week fifty year is not going to earn enough money to take care of himself or herself let alone and that is why i believe that anyone in america who works hours a week should not be living in poverty thats why i believe we should raise the minimum wage to a living wage over the next that every man in this room there with the women and make sure that we passed pay equity for women workers reason rational economic reason why women should be making cents on the dollar compared to men that is just oldfashioned sexism and together we are going to change that of politicians dropping through this and many republicans talk about family dogs just laws of their wealthy families of inmates can i ask you to keep up with keeping that light off and and they are really into family values but does everybody in this room know what they mean by sam divides what they need by family bonds is that no one in this room in the state in this country should be able to control your own body i strongly disagree now im not shocked you tell you that there is a lot of hypocrisy in politics i know youll be shocked when i think there is no greater example of hypocrisy and when it comes to a womans right to choose republicans running all over this country telling us how much they hate the federal government how much they hate government journal they want to cut social security and medicare investigate everything else they want to get the government watch your backs they want to live your life three country make your own decision accepts when it comes to the very personal decision that women sometimes have to make and then they love the government and they want to go to tell every woman in america her choice should be thats wrong thats hypocrisy i will fight that tooth also what we talked about republican family values but they also mean is that gay people in this country should not have the right to marry i strongly disagree with us grandchildren and what i talked about international of the united states only country on earth does not guarantee paid family and medical of workingclass women all lowincome women there is a strong likelihood that they will be forced to separate themselves from those newborn baby one week after birth two weeks after birth to go back to work earn enough income to do in my view that is not what family values are about that is the very opposite of what of family values about a mom and dad have the right to stay home with a newborn baby you have a right to stay home with your kids if your son or daughter is ill if your mom or dad is and that is why i should we will support and fight for three months of paid fairly dramatically now when we talk about our economy have the courage to take on some extremely powerful special interests because at the end of the day without being too rhetorical here real change never takes place without struggle thats been the history of the united states whether its been a civil rights movement has been workers movements in unions whether its been the womens movement the environmental movement the game thats what happens when we talk about our economy we have got to understand that the greed the recklessness and the illegal behavior of wall street is doing disastrous things working men and women in this country now everybody in this room those that wall streets behavior crashed the economy and so you all know that millions of people lost their jobs theyve lost their homes they lost their life savings and you helped bail them out they came running the congress and they said police bail out against michael congress bail them out now today eight years later you may not be shocked to know that the three largest three out of the four largest financial institutions in america are much bigger than they were when you bailed them out because they were too big to fail you might not be shocked to know that the six largest financial institutions have assets equivalent to percent of the gdp of the united states that they issue twothirds of the credit cards and onethird of the mortgages you might now be shocked to know that since and nine major financial institutions in this country have paid over to hundred billion dollars in fines for illegal activities or reached settlements with the government to avoid reading over two hundred billion dollars now mind you when you have a financial institution too big to fail it is too big to exist i believe we should break there small businesses farmers homeowners not as we currently have on wall street and i love unto itself only concerned about making as much money as they can for themselves also you know when weve talked about this why it is that so many of our people of the moralizing politically why so many people have given up on our democracy i think it has a lot to do a lot of factors out there but heres one of them people see market picked up for the possession of marijuana gets arrested has a criminal record see somebody else minor crime has a police record and yet the ceos of wall street firms firms that as i mentioned up a two hundred billion dollars in fines for illegal activities not one has been charged with a crime not one of them has a police so i believe maybe im oldfashioned about this we should not have banks that are too big to fail what bankers who are too big to jail all people in power earlier we have a corrupt oldfashioned conservative but what democracy means to me is one person one vote so if we were here all together and were trying to decide something you gotta vote everybody has an equal vote majority rules thats kind of my vision of democracy majority rules oneperson onevote but clearly that has been corrupted by the citizens united decision so let me make a promise to you that if elected president no not in need of mind to the supreme court will get that position unless he or she makes it very very clear and loud that they will vote to overturn citizens united because i am a passionate believer in democracy i want this country to have one larger one of the higher voter turnouts in the world not one of the low voter turnout since will live on our young people are just going from high school just before i want our kids to be thinking about the important issues i want serious debate in this country about serious issues and i will do everything that i can to expand voter turnout among many other things i will click on those republican governors and legislators were going out of their way to suppress the vote to make it harder for people in this country devote our job is to make it easier when we talk about this country everybody here knows that if our economy is going to be successful we need to have the best educated workforce in the world and unfortunately that is no longer the case of once while it is not the case to give you one absurd exam right now as we speak there are hundreds of thousands of bright and qualified young people who have the background have the building to go to college but cannot go to college for one reason and that reason is their families lack the funds to me that he is not only really unfair to those people but it is absurd as we look at our future economy where we need to tell all of the intellectual capabilities of people how many scientists and engineers in great teaches there who cannot afford to go to college right now so that is why i will fight to make sure that every public college and university in america is tuition free weve got to deal with another crisis outrageously high level of student debt in this country you have millions of people ive been reading a lot of your in iowa who are carrying that some whatever reduce into i met a woman to promote a couple years ago i dream was to get a medical degree and practice primary health care just exactly the kind of doctors we need she is now three hundred thousand dollars in debt and i thought that was the highest i was in the morning number of months ago after a spokeswoman comes up to me she says well bernie actually i graduated data school and we need to get this desperately thousand dollars in debt just brought to the way young man few days ago and it wasnt nearly and paying percent of his entire income back to the government is that thats pretty crazy stuff so what we wanted to also has not only made public colleges and universities tuitionfree we want to lower interest rates on student debt right now right now is that you can refinance your home what does it cost to refinance a home near percent refinance your home with percent and get your pain percent interest rates on student loans that does not make any sense were gonna give people the opportunity to refinance their loans at the lowest interest rates they can find i will tell you when they were in trouble well now the middle class is in trouble its wall streets turn to help working families now when we talk about but facing the entire planet it seems to me there is adults as parents and grandparents we have got to understand we have to leave this planet in a way that is healthy and is habitable our children now i am all united states and the energy committee and i thought the scientist not only all over our country but all over the world the debate is over climate change is real it is caused by human activity and it is already doing devastating to our country in many parts of the world as president i will take up the mantle of having the united states leads the world working with china russia india other countries in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel energy efficiency and sustainable energy and by the way let me congratulate the people are because you are one of the leading states in this country in terms of moving us toward sustainable energy wind and biofuels congratulations i oppose the construction of the box and piping energy to invest in energy efficiency and not become more dependent upon fossil fuels hope that everybody understands only major country on earth called the united states of america youve probably heard of that country that does not guarantee health care to all people know what that means is that in the uk canada france germany scandinavia metals whatever maybe countries have different healthcare systems but they are all together they all have a common goal of guaranteeing health care to all of their people know i helped write the affordable care act among our committee voted for it we got some good things and i worked out by the way with your former senator tom harkin but we still have despite the aca we start million people without any health insurance and even more under what it means that probably some of you a very large deductibles or copayments am i right on that talk about the doctor bills how much i was like a model where you have i mean there are is common person per family whatever it may be and what that means is that when people get sick and they dont have a lot of money they hesitate going to be so what ends up happening there and ive talked to doctors who said people walk into their offices and a doctor said company of six months ago and the persons of wealth health insurance i didnt have a high deductible sometimes those people dont like it but sometimes they end up in a hospital a great expense to the system and then on top of that our people paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs way back when the late nineteen nineties i took a busload of women from northern vermont over the canadian border and i did that because many of those women with breast cancer and they were able to buy the medicine brandname medicine that they needed in montreal for one tenth of the price they are paying in the united states one tenth of the price and thats probably change but we paid by far the highest prices in the world not just like in canada higher than any other major country on earth so you will not be shocked to know the while we pay the highest prices for prescription drugs while one out of five americans who get a prescription from a doctor cannot afford to fill that prescription while elderly people are cutting their pills in half because they cant afford to buy what they need the three major drug companies in this country last year made billion dollars in profits forty five billion dollars in parts so one of my very important goals as president is to have joined the rest of the industrialized world guarantee health care to all people control prescription drug costs and the best way to do that is doing medicare for all singlepayer program comprehensive health care we also say middleclass families thousands of dollars a year on their health care costs because we pay almost three times more than the british will provide healthcare all the people percent more than the french follower than the canadiens so the truth is we cannot comprehensive universal health care in a cost effective way if we have the courage to stand up to the private insurance companies and the drug to be just conclude by saying this will open up to your questions and comments and that is living in a country we are all living in which ordinary country but that over the last thirty years what we have seen is a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent the percentage of wealth of the top one tenth of one percent now owns has doubled doubled in the last years not being there i am talking about this afternoon is particularly radical everything that i am talking about exist in other countries around the world and virtually everything that i am talking about you supported by the vast majority of the american people the american people want us to raise the minimum wage for women workers they want us to rebuild our infrastructure they want jobs the kids run them put them in jail they want us to make sure that we lead the world in addressing climate change they want all of our people have health care fees on radical ideas but what has happened over the last many years is the united states government has become more and more separated from the needs of the middle class and working families and that has everything to do with the fact that the government is now controlled through campaign donations to a lobbying by a small number of corporations and very very wealthy individuals so what this campaign is about is not just selecting a person of course im here to ask for your support is to create a political revolution in which millions of people many of whom ive given up on the political process the gym to step up and say loudly and clearly our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors thank you all very muchdoing what is a difficult thing to do and that is to spend considerable amounts of time and energy trying to make this country a better place in which to live and work thank you all also say to every person in this room that all our worst we are a hundred times better than any of the republican candidates are the best say a special thanks to the many thousands of volunteers who have worked so hard on our campaign we started this campaign quite fall behind with your help we have made great progress and i appreciate all that you have done also want to thank the many unions and organizations too many to name for their support many others the communication workers of america united nurses united and the american postal workers union hampshire state employees association for their support and many other grassroots organization our campaign has had a great deal of energy and enthusiasm and i think the reasons are pretty obvious we are talking about the issues let working families and the middle class are concerned about we are talking about ending a corrupt campaign finance system american democracy is not about wall street and billion as buying elections american democracy is about one person one vote thats what the winglet is about promise i made to every person in this arena if elected president no nominee to the supreme court will get that position unless he or she is very clear they will vote to overturn citizens united we will address rigged economy that so many of working people are suffering on the right now it is not acceptable to me that at the same time as we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth we also higher income and wealth inequality that any other major country on earth to the billionaire class we are going to create an economy that works for working families not just the people on trial elected president we are going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage and grace of women make in cents on the dollar compared to that and we will pay equity for women workers in this country to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of decent paying jobs trade disastrous trade system and we are going to tell corporate america start investing in this country not just in china we are going to say that public colleges and universities should be questioned three i want every child in this country families like mine where my mom and dad to college i want those kids in manchester new hampshire early to understand to understand that if they do their schoolwork seriously if they do their homework and have a serious reasons yes they will be able to get a college education regardless of the end of their families and all of those people in our country some young and some not so young people who are now being crushed by outrageously high levels of student debt relief is on the way will give we will give those millions of people today sometimes paying twenty twentyfive percent of their income in student debt we are going to low interest rates to make your debt more bearable senior citizens of new hampshire many of whom are trying to get by on eleven twelve thirteen thousand dollars a year in social security i understand you understand that people can not get by on eleven twelve thirteen thousand dollars a year colleagues say we should cut social security we should expect and social security benefits we are going to light lifting the cap on taxable income and the large multinational corporations who continued to believe that its okay for them to put their billions of dollars in profits in the cayman islands and bermuda and another tax havens weve got news for you going to start paying your fair share of taxes on wall street people whose greed and recklessness this illegal behavior drug this economy into the worst recession since the nineteen thirties bailed out by the middle class of this country the cost of banks are too big to fail but today in many cases are bigger than when we bailed them out we are going to establish a st century glass six major bugs assets of almost sixty percent of the gdp of this country yes we are going to break up coal industry charges r us highest prices in the world for the medicine we need created a situation in which one out of five americans are unable to buy the medicine their doctors prescribe we say to them days of raising prices off the charge million people who are undocumented living in the shadows earful about being deported we say we share your pain and we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform shamefully shamefully has more people in jail than any other country on earth we say there will be real criminal justice reform education and jobs for our kids not jails and it costs erection we say that we are tired of seeing people shot down by police a police officer who breaks the law like any other public official must be held accountable demilitarize local police departments we must make police departments all across this country look like the diversity of the communities they serve i have been criticized because i believe all of our people in this great country are entitled to health care let me be as clear as i can i confess i believe that health care is a right of all people not a privilege i believe that the affordable care act which my committee committee upon helped to write has done some extraordinarily good things we should be proud of that we can go further and i believe that we should move to medicare for all singlepayer program leadership is a bow is not just swimming with the current its not just coming up blood ideas when there is a majority support for those ideas before it was fashionable in the early nineteen nineties congressman burdick said oppose nafta and other trade agreements corporate america to invest in this country create jobs in this country not just in china i voted against the socalled defense of marriage act and i believe that people have a right to love whoever they want regardless of their child nineteen nineties what all kinds of people in this country republicans and yes some democrats said we should deregulate wall street what a great idea it would be if commercial banks and insurance and commercial banks that invested bags and insurance companies could merge i didnt think it was such a good idea helped lead the opposition to deregulation in and most important debate in recent history on foreign policy took place george w bush dick cheney they say it was a good idea to invade iraq i listen very carefully to what they said i didnt believe them i not only voted against that wall i helped lead the opposition to that war standing up and be counted when the times are rough when you are in a minority situation also producing the goods passing legislation that impacts the people of the hampshire for a month and in america of the veterans committee i helped pass the most comprehension of veterans healthcare legislation passed in the modern history of this country not only help millions of veterans all over this country get better access to va health care it was of particular benefit to the veterans of the state of new hampshire language in the bill that benefit hampshire veterans and i i am proud that is part of the affordable care act twelve billion dollars in it to expand community house and north hampshire and vermont and all over this country past one of the most significant pieces of environmental legislation putting billions of dollars to help communities become less energy efficient and move to sustainable energy this no president not bernie sanders or anybody else can bring about the changes that the middle class and working families of this country desperately need and the reason for that is that the powers that be wall street corporate america the corporate media the koch brothers the large coke campaign dont use so powerful so powerful that the only way we create the change that we need is through a political revolution millions and millions of people throughout our country including many who have given up on the political process many who think their vote their voice no longer matters those people have got to reengage politically working people lowincome people young people and with a loud voice a loud voice voice heard on tuesday in the hampshire and heard all over this country voice which says that this couple hours for it and defended by so many men and women who prepared to put their lives on the line this government of ours belongs to all of us not a handful of wealthy campaign contributorsapathy enemy is sinister we have the solution for that please allow me to introduce to you the next president of the united states of america so that are running howd you like the pics of history going not been done that is put together a grassroots movement which takes on and defeat the political and economic establishment of his country all over this country not just that maybe just maybe we have a government that represents the middle class and working families rather than building a corporate america win just so you know what goes on politically in this country the rich get richer everybody else gets coral and then people get dissolution and they say you know i cant afford to send my kids to college or working what are these guys going on a boat facts are wrong right answer is we and we change their own woman born in this country draw is together to fight for gender the works for all people a handful i dont know i dont know what are trying a little bit strange that is the wealthiest country in the history of the world really high rate of childhood poverty right a little weird well quality than any other major country on earth where the top almost as much well as the bottom right weve got people were true with three drawers hours a week get percent of all new income percent right this country we have more people in jail proportionately africanamerican and hispanic more people to tell that any other country order prior to be maybe it makes more sense for us to win education education rather than jails and it cost a little bit strange to me that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world which is what we are today we are the only major country that doesnt guarantee healthcare go over well as a right of the trade my republican colleagues about family values what theyre really talking about youre saying that we should not be able to control their own bodies talking about talk about their brothers and sisters should not be able to get buried my wife and i place got quarter to seven grandchildren we have a different set of how about a united states joins the rest of the world in case you dont have to live on a level of social security maybe we raised and expand social security benefits maybe we tell the truck companies to stop ripping off the american people i wanna see this country the most vibrant democracy in the world i dont want to see your voter turnouts as we did a year ago when percent of americans vote eighty percent of young people know thats not what american democracy should be about voter suppression we are going to make it easier for people to not harder and the other thing that were gonna do as we restore real democracy to this country were going to overturn this disastrous citizens united supreme court tell you that we are very few major presidential campaigns that does not have a super pac i dont have a billion or corporate america and i am immensely proud to tell you what we have received more individual campaign contributions at this point in the campaign that any campaign in american history we are running we are running president election works in other words one of the things that we are talking about i want to the pictures high school degree you can take care of your family today so what seems sensible is that when we think of public education we have to expand beyond great which is why i am fighting public colleges and universities to we should three and why we are also going to substantially lower interest rates on student but heres how were going to raise money and why i need your help to make this happen a speculation acts on wall street happy about this one then when as a result of the reckless and illegal behavior you now here i put them to help the middle class of this country or look out the window read your emails listen thats what the american people want is creating a political revolution your friends president if youre interested in transforming the united states of america if youre interested in participating in a political revolution we need your help thank younow on to the south and west [applause] [cheers] mr sanders thank you thank you new hampshire [applause] shortly after the polls closed secretary clinton called and was very gracious in her congratulations i thank her for her call i congratulate her and her supporters for the vigorous campaign they ran in new hampshire let me take this opportunity to thank the many many thousands of volunteers here in the granite state who worked so tirelessly [applause] our volunteers worked night and day made phone calls and knock on a lot of doors [applause] and we won because of your energy thank you all so much i want to thank julia barnes and our great campaign staff [applause] together we have sent a message that will echo from wall street to washington from maine to california and that is that the government of our great country belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors and their super pacs [applause] nine months ago we began our campaign here in new hampshire we had no campaign organization we had no money and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the united states of america tonight with what appears to be a recordbreaking voter turnout [applause] because of a huge voter turnout and i say huge we won because we harnessed the energy and the excitement that the democratic party will need to succeed in november [applause] what happened here in new hampshire in terms of an enthusiastic and aroused electorate people came out in large numbers that is what will happen all over this country lets never forget them democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high republicans win when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low tonight we serve notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the american people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining american democracy and we will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary americans work longer hours for lower wages while almost all new income and wealth goes to the top [applause] i want to take this opportunity again to congratulate secretary clinton in her and were organization and supporters for waging a vigorous campaign i hope in the days again ahead we can continue to wage a strong issue oriented campaign and bring new people into the political process but i also hope that we all remember and this is a message not just to our opponents but to those who support me as well that we will need to come together in a few months and unite this party and this nation because the right wing republicans we oppose must not be allowed to gain the presidency [applause] as we all remember the last time republicans occupied the white house their trickledown economic policies drove us into the worst economic downturn since the depression of the s no we will not allow huge tax breaks for billionaires we will not allow huge cuts to social security medicare medicaid and education [applause] no we will not allow back into the white house a political party which is so bold eholden to the fossil fuel industry that they cannot even acknowledge the scientific reality of climate change [applause] the people of new hampshire have sent a profound message to the political establishment to the economic establishment and by the way the media establishment [applause] bernie bernie bernie bernie bernie mr sanders what the people here have said is that given the enormous crises facing our country it is just too late for the same old same old establishment politics and establishment economics the people want real change [applause] what the american people are saying by the way i hear it is not just from progressives but from conservatives and from moderates is that we can no longer continue to have a campaign finance system in which wall street and the billionaire class are able to buy elections [applause] americans americans no matter what their political view may be understand that that is not what democracy is about that is what a la dark he is about is about we will not allow that to continue [applause] i do not have a super pac and i do not want a super pac [applause] i am overwhelmed and i am deeply moved far more than i can express in words by the fact that our campaign ss financial support comes from more than one million americans who have made of more than million in individual contributions [applause] that is more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of the united states up until this point in an election [applause] and you know what that average contribution was [applause] i am going to new york city tonight and tomorrow but im not going to new york city to hold a fundraiser on wall street instead im going to hold a fundraiser right here right now across america my request is please go to berniesanderscom and contribute please help us raise the funds we need whether it is or or help us raise the money we need to take the fight to nevada south carolina and the state on super tuesday there it is that is our fundraiser what the american people understand is our great country was based on a simple principle and that principle is fairness let me be very clear it is not fair when we have more income and wealth inequality today than almost any major country on earth and when the top / of now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom that is not fair it is not fair when the th wealthiest people in this country now own more wealth than the bottom half than the american people are you guys ready for a radical idea together we are going to create in economy that works for all of us not just the [applause] and when millions of our people are working with starvation wages yes we are going to raise the minimum wage to an hour an hour and we are going to bring pay equity for women [applause] and when we need the best educated workforce in the world yes we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free and for the millions of americans struggling with horrendous levels of student debt we are going to ease that burden [applause] in america people should not be financially distressed for decades for the crime of trying to get a higher education that is absurd my critics say that is a great idea you are into this great stuff how will you pay for it i will tell you how we will impose a tax on wall street speculation the greed drove our economy to its knees the american people bailed out wall street now it is wall streets time to help the middle class when we talk about transforming america it means ending that his of this country having more people in jail than any other country in the world disproportionately africanamerican and latino not only are we going to fight to end institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system [applause] we are going to provide jobs and education for our young people not jails and incarceration the debate is over climate change is real it is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems in this country and around the world we have a moral responsibility to work with countries throughout the world to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy [applause] now i have been criticized during this campaign for many many things every single day that is ok that is all right they are throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink and i have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well what are campaign is about is thinking big not small it is about having the courage to reject the status quo [applause] it is about saying there is a time when every major country on earth during times health care guarantees health care to all of its people we should be doing the same in our great country in my view under president obamas leadership before the care act has been the affordable care act has been an important step forward but we can and must do better [applause] million americans should not remain uninsured and an even greater number should not be underinsured with large deductibles and copayments we should not be paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs listen to this at a time when the top three drug companies in this country make billion in profits last year [booing] that is an obscenity let me tell you something when we make it to the white house [applause] when we make it to the white house the pharmaceutical industry will not continue to rip off the american people it makes no sense as a nation we continue to spend far more per capital or capita per capita than any other nation that guarantees health care to all of their people and that is why i believe in medicare for all singlepayer programs [applause] which will not only guarantee health care for all but will save the average middleclass family thousands of dollars a year in health care costs [applause] my friends we all know that we live in a dangerous and complex world as president i will defend this nation but i will do it responsibly [applause] i voted against the war in iraq [applause] and that was the right vote while we must be present relentless in combating terrorists who will do us harm we cannot and should not be the policeman of the world [applause] nor should we bear the burden of fighting terrorism alone in the middle east the united states must be part of an international coalition sustained by nations in the region that have the means to protect themselves together we must and will destroy isis but we must do it in a way that does not put our young men and women in the military into perpetual warfare in the middle east [applause] my friends we must fix our broken immigration system that divides families and create a path towards citizenship for hardworking people that are living in the shadows [applause] we must strengthen and expand social security and increase the benefits that seniors and disabled veterans receive so that people can live in dignity [applause] we must rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and when we do that we create millions of decent paying jobs we must pursue the fight for womens rights gay rights for disability rights [applause] we must again stronger opposition or check the right of a woman to control her own body [applause] and we must protect the men and women who serve our nation in uniform and protect our veterans who put their life on the line to defend us [applause] my friends we must hold the billionaire class and the that they cannot have it all at a time of massive wealth and income inequality the wealthiest people and largest corporations in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes [applause] my friends i am the son of a polish immigrant who came to this country speaking no english and having no money my father worked every day of his life and he never made a whole lot my mom and dad my brother and i grew up in a small rentcontrolled apartment in brooklyn new york my mother who died at a young age always dreamed of moving out of that apartment getting a home of our own but you never realized that dream the truth is neither one could have dreamed i would be year tonight here tonight standing before you as a candidate for president of the united states [applause] bernie bernie bernie bernie bernie bernie bernie mr sanders this is the promise of america and this is the promise we must keep alive for future generations what began last week in iowa what voters here in new hampshire confirmed tonight is nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution [applause] it is a political revolution that will bring tens of millions of our people together people who have given up on the political process it will bring together young people who had never participated in the political process it will bring together blacks and whites asianamericans native americans female and people who immigrated here [applause] we will all come together to say loudly and clearly that the government of our great nation belongs to all of us not just a few wealthy campaign contributors [applause] that is what this campaign is about that is what the political revolution is about so new hampshire thank you again and now it is on

know that as americans we are appalled we are disgusted by the attack against the people of paris by the terrorist organization and i know i speak for everyone everyone in our country when we send our condolences to the families who lost loved ones and that barbaric attack in our prayers go out with speedy recoveries for the many hundreds more were injured in my view now is the time for developing serious and effective strategy now is not the time for cheap political talk were trying to take political advantage of this difficult moment now president obama is trying to do to unite the world and an organized campaign against taxes by bringing together all the country interest in the international countries countries president we will not live in field i am hearing my republican colleagues that i will just say this we will not succumb to racism sitcom called everything but the shorts on their backs we will not turn our backs on the refugee americans most importantly we will learn the lessons of history yesterday the chairman of the republican national committee stated and i quote never before have i seen an american president president obama project such weakness on the global stage end of quote many of you will remember back in two thousand and two we had president president bush president bush president but not very spot dick cheney the whole lot of them they would talk and then we should invade iraq virtually alone in the result was brave men and women from our country hundreds of thousands of people where an emotional many many iraqis dead and wounded in the region that we are paying the price today for the instability and that chaos my republican colleagues yeah but not we create a worldwide coalition that will defeat isis but no the united states of america must not be involved in perpetual war in the middle east something else they were closed including many republicans media who think that because of this horrific attack only thing that we should focus on is the feeding ice and what i say use yes we will leave the world in defeating i but at the same time we will rebuild the disappearing middle class of this country and we can accomplish both goals the campaign that we all know about six months ago six months ago we began this campaign with no money no organization and frankly very few people in ohio for the rest of the country well we have come in six and a half months way out over people to rallies like this all over america thousands of volunteers in every state in this country when the pundits and the experts said you know you cant run a serious political campaign without a super pac without raising money from corporations and millionaires we are doing proud to tell you that as of today we have approximately americans made individual contributions to our campaign contribution that any campaign in the history of america at this point in a campaign campaign money money we dont need and were very simply enter the turn aesthetic few moments ago very serious problems and the american people gone that establishment politics and establishment economics is not going to solve those problems understand is that a time when wall street in corporate america and large campaign donors have so much power people instinctively understand that no president not burning send is not anybody else ill be enormous problems that we face the web people know and what campaign its not just selecting a president it is creating a political revolution in the last election sixtythree percent of the american people didnt vote percent of young people didnt vote vast majority of lowincome working people didnt vote what our job and its not an easy job to reach out to tens of millions of americans who are working in many cases longer hours for low wages sometimes they can afford to feed their kids they cant afford to send their kids to college i would draw is to reach out to bring people together black and white hispanic asian americans gay and straight country people who immigrated to this country because we lose we cannot accomplish thats what people in this country and when we come together we can defeat but people with money all over this country given a lot of speeches and one of the best compliments ive received came from a guy i think was out on the west coast he said you know burning what i like about you is your treating us like we are intelligent people campaign is about fancy gimmicks me tell you all kinds of jokes cant do that are not much of a sense of humor tell you all about my beautiful family of my beautiful grandchildren but what i will do with you which we dont do enough simply lay on the table the most serious issues facing our country that is what democracy is about democracy is not what the media thinks it is its not a soap opera its not a baseball game because of what the polls are done matter what what democracy is about presumably is also talking about the issues that we face respectfully respectfully arguing about those issues then coming together to resolve those couples remember every problem that we face was caused by human decisions every problem that we face can be overcome by better decisions talking about an issue the talking about for a very long time and i am happy that now we are beginning to see more and more people discuss it and that is the issue of the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that exists in america today whats going on plain and simple in the united states today we have more income and wealth inequality that almost any major country on earth and it is worse today than at any time since today the extent of the problem today in america the top one tenth of one percent onetenth of one percent almost as much well as the bottom one but walton family of walmart more wealth than the bottom forty percent of the american people in the last two year but fourteen wealthiest people in this country have seen their wealth increase by a hundred and fifty six billion dollars more wealth is owned in a targeted by the bottom hundred and thirty million americans in vermont all across this country and i see it as like crap you got people who are not working one job of putting out was working two jobs maybe theyre working three jobs husbands are working why it wasnt working kids of working all trying to cobble together the income they need does the slaying the body health care put gas in the car to pay the electric bills and yet today in america of new income is going to the top one percent campaign is simply site is creating an economy that works for all of us and not just million head billion and theres campaign is sending a simple and straightforward message that the billionaire place and that is in america when people the power billion class will not happen children go hungry not continue sending our jobs to china when millions of people are in desperate need of good paying work here in america they will not give huge compensation packages to the ceos of large corporations when they cut the wages and pensions and health care and let me just recognize i think some of the teamster friends all over this country a promise that was made to tens of thousands of workers in guaranteeing them their pensions if you have anything to say about it and marcy kaptur of ohio when i do to make sure that will not be caught whats going on in america we have to take a deep breath just take a hard look at what we see around us i see i see that today our economy is in fact better than it was when george bush left office something our republican friends we shouldnt be too hard on them because they suffer from a very serious illness called amnesia they could get public in friends are listening try to overcome let me remind you of seven years ago before obama and biden took office my republican friends say well you know were only going to jobs a month not enough theyre right but its a hell of a lot better to grow jobs than jobs my republican colleagues against suffering from this very seriously they worry about the deficit not as a serious problem but they forgot when bush left office we had a recordbreaking one point four trillion dollar deficit weve cut that but true and by the way when bush left office the american and international financial system was on the verge of collapse just in passing we might want to mention that the truth is we have made significant progress in the last seven years against unprecedented republican obstructionism on the democratic president and republican presidents the great middle class of our country once the envy of the entire world has in fact been disappearing despite exploding technology and increased worker productivity median family income today is almost less than it was in and in and the dollars we have millions of people working men and women who are earning less money than was the case thirty or forty years ago thats the reality so the question to ask ourselves is how does it happen that when workers are producing more because of exploding technology they are earning less and working longer hours we are going and let me tell you something else we talk about the economy every month us government issues a report on unemployment and what you see on the front page of the paper thought official unemployment which actually is about but what you dont see is that if you add to that people who have given up looking for work or people who are working part time when they want to work full time real unemployment is close to percent that we virtually never discuss and that is the tragedy of youth unemployment in this country i asked him economists couple of months ago to do a study for me this is what they found him listen to this because this is really very significant what they fell is that for high school graduates graduates not dropouts between the ages of and white kids real unemployment and underemployment is percent for hispanic kids for africanamerican kids like what kids want to graduate high school they want to stand up on their own two feet about to get out of the house they want to start earning some money they want to become independent they want to slaughter korea wanna become adults but when half of the africanamerican kids in this country and its cities like cleveland that number may even be on white kids in this country are unable to stand on their own two feet and get out and get a decent job bad things begin to happen anybody here there is a direct correlation between outrageously high youth unemployment and the fact that we as a nation have more people in jail than any other country on earth you would be mistaking tell you i think is the most common sense but its out there and that is that instead of investing in jails and cost erection maybe we should invest in jobs and education billion dollars a year blocking our people why dont we take a fraction of but and use it to create jobs for young people hanging out on street corners heck of a lot less money to send somebody to the university of ohio that put him in jail right there at the end of my first term as president the united states of america will not have more people in jail than any other country were going to have the best in the world economy brothers and sisters it is not only the protest level of income and wealth inequality thats not only unemployment it is the fact that in your state and in my state and all over this country people working longer hours for low wages and theyre working at wages that do not sustain themselves or their families and there are people all working hours a week and then they have to go to the food shelf in order to get food to feed their families that wage earners in america are too damn low up seven and a quarter an hour heres a spot wage in this country living wage bucks and hour over the next and when we talk about fair wages i hope every man he will stand with the women pay equity for women working there is no economic reason why women are making cents on the dollar compared to men it is sex is not acceptable a word about family values you heard many republicans expressing deep deep concern families especially very wealthy families might contribute to their campaigns passionate about unquote family bounds and everyone here knows what they mean by family what they mean is that no woman in america should have the right to control her own body and what they mean by family values is that our gay brothers and sisters should not have the right to get married i disagree senator mixture the early are very blessed to have great kids and seven beautiful grandchildren and my wife jane and i have been married for years we believe in family and we believe in family values but our values just a little bit different than republican family guys talk about family values what i am talking about is ending the international embarrassment of the united states of america being the only major country on earth does not guarantee hey family and medical leave it is not a family value to tell a woman who has just given birth that she has to be separated a week or two after giving birth from her baby has to go back to work and order to earn the necessary income she needs to sustain that family could cause there is no additional income coming under heres the good news the good news is that in the congress in the senate and in the house there is a very small piece of legislation the family and medical leave act we got nineteen sponsors in the senate introduced by senator gillibrand in the house we have over a hundred introduced by congresswoman rosa delauro and what this legislation says of what i strongly believe is that in america we will guarantee every family three months of pay to those families third of the income they were and we do that all the cost of about week not a bit price to pay a buck a week my hope is that every candidate for president especially those who talk about family values will come on board and support legislation when we talk about the economy and when pollsters go out in the cold what is on your mind what is on the minds of the american people always always always the answer is jobs and the economy because people understand how volatile the economy as they understand that if you up years of age you can go to work tomorrow and your boss could say well for thirty years of work joke but we were facing you with somebody half your age and half and they understand that if youre a college graduate it is hard to get work commensurate with your education high school kid drop out it is hard to find any work in any way that is why in my view given unemployment underemployment the outrageous level youth unemployment the federal government must undertake a massive federal jobs program to put our people back to work we should firing teachers and child care workers our infrastructure roads bridges water systems wastewater plants our rail system our airports all levels and else in many safe are collapsing we can create millions of decent paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure and output by the way and let me say this very clearly to the folks in ohio when we talk about jobs its not only creating goodpaying jobs it is preventing the loss of goodpaying jobs because of disastrous trade policies congressman and a senator who proudly tells you he voted against nafta against permanent normal trade relations helped lead the effort to defeat this disastrous transpacific partnership corporate america likes it or not theyre investing in the united states of america creating jobs here not just in china and vietnam when we use words like greed and fraud and dishonesty and allergens these are just a few of the adjectives we can use to describe wall street everybody here knows is that the greed and recklessness and the illegal behavior on wall street pro this country into the worst economic downturn since the great depression and what happened is that millions of people jobs found new jobs many of them lost their homes and many people lost their life savings making retirement much more typical we need banking system in this country that is part of the probe dr economy that provides affordable loans to small and mediumsized businesses so they can create jobs need a banking system in which the largest financial institutions in this country assets equivalent to percent of the gdp of america financial institutions which issue twothirds of the credit cards onethird of the mortgages when you have financial institutions and water that have so much economic power so much political power during the effort to deregulate wall street which helped lead the opposition to they spent wall street spent five billion dollars over a tenyear period on lobbying and campaign contributions when you have an entity like water which has so much economic and political power which is making so many campaign contributions to super pacs democrats and republicans the answer to what we have to do is obvious and that is reestablished glass steagle break up financial institutions of bible way three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country today are bigger now than they were when we bailed him out because they were too big to fail financial institution is too big to fail it is too big to exist legislation to take marijuana out of the controlled substance number of reasons most importantly over the last many many years hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people have been arrested for possessing marijuana and they get police records police record it makes life difficult it makes it much harder to go out and get a jet go get a job it makes it harder to find housing to get the same credit and in some cases people ended up in jail so i find it very interesting in terms of a broken criminal justice system might find interesting that hundreds of thousands of people have criminal records for possessing marijuana but not one ceo on wall street criminal record bring major major reforms a broken criminal justice system we should not be a country in which we have banks too big to fail and bankers too big to jail i am asked you know bernie which particular issue is the most important i can never answer them because all of these issues are so terribly important but there is one issue which impacts all other issues and that is five years ago the supreme court in one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of the supreme court on the citizens united case the wealthiest people in this country they said guys you already own much of the economy now were going to allow you to purchase united states government and that is what they are trying to do right now very proud to tell you ima former chairman of the uss senate committee on veterans affairs we worked very hard to protect the interests of our veterans talk to some wonderful people were fought in world what career in vietnam only through iraq and afghanistan and these people have put their lives on the line and of course many of our soldiers never came home to defend american democracy american democracy is not about billionaires buying elections a situation where the second wealthiest families in this country the koch brothers in a few of their friends heard the koch brothers and spend some million dollars in an election cycle more money the democratic or republican party will spend that is not democracy that is oligarchy and we thought that i make you know nominee of mine to the supreme court will get that position unless he or she is loud and clear in saying they will vote to overturn citizens united democracy together we are going to stand up and tell republican governors and legislators they will not get away with suppressing the vote people old people young people that they cannot vote because on line for hours in order to exercise their democratic right to vote we are going through a constitutional amendment or some other way we are going to reach the day went simply and straightforwardly anybody years of age or older have the right to vote and the discussion dont have the guts to participate in free and fair elections these cowards should get another job in america in which we have not one of the lowest voter turnout in the industrialized world but one to make it easy for people to participate in the political process not hard in a very competitive global economy and in that context it makes sense to me that we are hundreds of thousands of bright and qualified young people who want to go to college who shot the in college but cant go to college for one reason and that is their families lack the should be about and that is why i have introduced legislation and will make happen its president a process in which every public college and university in america is appreciate what that is about telling every kid in cleveland and in burlington vermont that no matter what your income if you study hard if you do your schoolwork seriously you will be able to get a college education and we are also going to deal with the outrage of millions of people having high interest rates on their student debt nonsense to be there people are paying percent interest rates on student debt when you can refinance a home for three or four percent people with student that to get the lowest possible interest rates they can find providing the public colleges universities and lowering student interest rates an expensive proposition we are going to pay for that by imposing a tax on wall street as a result of their greed and recklessness crashed they came running to the congress and begging us to bail now to help the middle class when we talk about our responsibilities as adults as citizens as parents one of those responsibilities is to make sure that really future generations a planet that is healthy and a half the debate over climate change is real causing devastating problems and we have a moral responsibility to work with countries around the world to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and if we do not do that but the scientists tell us the end of this century this planet will be up to five degrees warmer than it is today more droughts or floods more extreme weather disturbances we have a moral responsibility to make sure that does not happen and when we talk about where we should also recognize that today the united states of america is the only major country on earth does not guarantee health care to all people on the committee that wrote the affordable care act that we have made some good progress in this country through the affordable care act we can and we must do million people still have health insurance and many more are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments major country on earth can guarantee health care to all of their people in a much more cost effective way than we do how can the united states of america cant do that when we gone through an issue which is also very much on our minds and ideas as a nation the understanding that we have got to put an end to institutional racism not just talking about very sick individuals some months ago for example walked into a church bible study class in charleston south carolina just killed nine people because of the color of their skin and im not talking about and it was only able to be thinking about this we have hundreds of organizations in this country whose sole function is to push forward americans hatred against immigrants hatred against catholics hatred against jews thats what they do but im not just talking about that what i am talking about is the fact that in this country we have seen and weve seen much too often too many africanamericans on all killed by the police when and cost two other sons are bland and michael brown or a keyboard or called horrible pretty great arrives i do not want to read about or see and you do not want to read about was see children being shot because they have a choice gun continue to see over bullets being shot into a call the largest city in the state of vermont burlington vermont i had the privilege of working with our police lawmen and let me tell you what i think most of you know most police officers are honest and hardworking and do it very difficult job many of them are under pain they have crazy schedules but also very clear and that is when any police officer any public official breaks the law that must be held accountable tonight no president will work harder than i and ending institutional racism in this country and in report for forming a very very broke in criminal justice system a few of the things that have to be done first thought we have got to demilitarize our police departments television local police look like theyre invading the community they are supposed to be serviced good or good police department and there are many of them are part of the community are trusted by the community on not seen theres a foreign invading force that reflect the diversity of the communities they serve allowable use outlaws late late is the last resort not the first one introduced legislation to do this of private corporations making profits by building and running prisons and detention drug and medical and mental health intervention addiction should be seen as an illness and treated as such today from prison to civil society and when we talk about issues facing our country i want everybody here not to forget that there are million people in this country today who are undocumented who are living in fear and living in the shuttles people mosque how the rights of legal status we must pass comprehensive immigration and we must follow a path toward citizenship hope what i hope that we can do as a nation and as a people is to think big not small we are many people dont know what we today on the wealthiest nation in the history of the world most people dont know that because almost all of the well is resting in the hands of a few i would say that ever wealthiest nation in the history of the world with an enormously productive work with some great universities and scientists and teaches there is nothing if we put our mind that we cannot accomplish dont get yourself involved in a world view which says well do we cut education by raise it by one percent that is not the dynamic that we should be looking out is that in the wealthiest country on earth why is the situation existing in which every parent to work knows that his or her kids are in the best quality prek and child care in the world we can do it tell me why we cannot do what many other countries do and make sure that everybody in the country has the ability of the file is able to get all of the education regardless of why cant we do in this country we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth though told me we have to have told me that the united states that the united states has to be the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people provide paid family and medical leave united states has to continue having more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth and how corporations that make billions but we end up paying a given year almost nothing in taxes dont tell me that that is what country we have to be that we can have the best health care system in the world for all about people to tell me that we can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combating climate change workers in america will not be losing the patrons they were provided and people with disabilities well in fact see an increase in their social security benefits not a cut there together we will and racism sexism but contrary we can create when we come to go when we stand up and fight back and when we create a dog that works for all and not just a handful of billion revolutioncool like them hard i would tell everybody to sit down whether or not seems like ill let me begin to tell you to do so well my wife we just celebrated not want the southern wedding anniversary the you know i which is why do you always look with a warning we couldnt believe it song media most likely sold the and what the mall soul let me also apologized we didnt have a look who we is about days ago we said were going to build more than i walk lets go to minnesota who pupil show off we sbs

you keep it silent we want you to continue the conversation by tweeting at geopolitics using the hashtag bernie at to you now without further ado please help me while going senator bernie sanders on this beautiful day shwetha wonderful introduction my message to you all today pretty simple one and that is our country faces enormous problems and these problems are not going to be solved if people turn away from political struggle of people throw up their hands and thus parents i dont wanna get involved its all crap you are getting a great education here in georgetown and i hope very much you will learn use what you have learned here to fight to create a better world and to follow in the traditions of so many people for so many years have struggled to create a more democratic and just society let me take you now back to the and in his inaugural address in the midst of the great depression president franklin delano roosevelt looked out at the nation thats the discoverable depression and this is what he saw and talked about in his inaugural tens of millions of people denied the basic necessities of life he saw millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the ball a family disaster home over them every single day he saw millions of his fellow americans denied education recreation and the opportunity to better their lot in the lot of their children he saw millions lack the means to buy the products they needed and biovail poverty by their lack of disposable income denying employment too many other millions because when you dont have money to spend youre not creating jobs for other people he saw one third of a nation in house bill clyde and ill and he acted against the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day people he called the economic royalists roosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of americans back to work took them out of dire poverty and restored their faith in government he redefined the relationship of the federal government to the people of our nation he combat it citizenm fear and despair he reinvigorated democracy he transformed our country and that is exactly what we have to do today and by the way almost everything he proposed almost every program every idea he introduced was called socialist i thought i would mention that just in passing social security which all of you know transformed life was senior citizens in this country was defined by his opponents as socialist the concept of the minimum wage that workers had to be paid at least certain amount of money for their labor was seen as a radical intrusion into the marketplace and was described as socialist unemployment insurance when you lose your job you have something to fall back upon abolishing child labor and the fact that children of eight ten twelve years of age were working in factories are working in the fields the hour work week collective bargaining the rights of workers to engage in negotiations with the union banking regulations deposit insurance and job programs that put millions of people to work for all described in one way or another as socialist yet as you all know all of these programs and many more have become the fabric of our nation and in fact the foundation of our middle class thirty years later after roosevelts speech at the nineteen sixties president lyndon johnson medicare and medicaid to provide health care to millions of senior citizens and families with children persons with disabilities and some of the most vulnerable people in this country today medicaid does not seem to be such a terribly radical idea to save them when somebody gets old they should have medical insurance but when it was proposed once again were hired rightwing forces describe these programs as socialistic and a threat to the american way of life that was then now is now today in the year in despite the wall street crash of which drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the great depression the american people are clearly better off economically than they were in but here is a very hard truth that we must acknowledge we must address we must not sweep under the rock and that is despite a huge increase in technology and i i was mayor of the city of burlington vermont anybody hear from vermont in the nineteen eighties a radical development took place we got computers in city hall nineteen eighties despite a huge increase in technology and worker productivity meeting that almost every worker in america with that technology is producing a lot more than workers that came before despite major growth gdp and a huge increase in the global economy hands of millions of american families continued today to lack the basic necessities of life while millions more struggle every day to provide a minimum standard of living for their families and i hope none of you will turn your back on that reality and the truth is and again this is a truth we must put on the table yes we are better off today economically than we were seven years ago when bush left office but the other truth is that for the last forty years or two years on the republican leadership and democratic leadership the great middle class of our country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low new technology increase worker productivity productivity people work longer hours for low wages faith in our political system now extremely low the very rich get richer almost everyone else gets super pacs funded by billionaire has by elections koch brothers alone in a few of their friends will spend more money in this election cycle than either the democratic or republican partys ordinary people working people young people dont vote we have any economic and political crisis in this country and the same old same old politics and economics will not effectively address those crises if we are serious about transforming our country and i hope all of you are serious about transforming our country if we are serious about rebuilding the american middle class if we are serious about reinvigorating american democracy we need to develop a political movement which once again is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation terms like ruling class probably georgetown and in my view the billionaire class must be told loudly and clearly that they cannot have it all our government belongs to all of us not just a handful of billionaires politics and culture which has reminded us can not just be based on the worship of money we must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super yachts while children in america go hungry and veterans men and women will put their lives on the line to defend us sleep out on the streets today in america we all the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but few americans know that because so much of the new income and wealth is going to the people on top in fact over the last thirty years there has been a massive redistribution of wealth problem is it has gone in the wrong direction trillion dollars from the hands of working families and the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent a handful of people top onetenth of one percent who have seen a doubling of the percentage of the wealth that they own during that period doubling of the percentage wealth they are unbelievably and grotesquely the top one tenth of one percent today nearly as much well as the bottom onetenth of one percent owns nearly as much well as the bottom that is not the kind of america that we should accept i can tell you that in my state of vermont and all over this country it is absolutely not uncommon to see people working two jobs or three jobs the cobble together the income of the health care they and their families need in fact americans work longer hours than do the people of any other industrialized country but despite the fact that all people are working so hard i go around the country and i see a lot of working people and you can see the stress and exhaustion on their faces their work increasing our husbands hardly see wives people dont have the quality time for their kids because the working so hard just to bring up bringing the income to survive event despite all of that despite our people working so hard d eight percent of all new income generated today is going to the top one percent today in america is the middle class continues to disappear median family income is less than it was in the median male worker made over less than he did forty two years ago in inflationadjusted dollars you know why people are angry they are angry because they are working terribly hard and getting real inflationadjusted dollars they are earning less and they look at all over a nice im whats happening why you stopped but its not just last year the media fame female worker earned more than less than she did in and seven and percent of all new income goes to the top one percent today in america the wealthiest country in the history of the world thats what we ought today more than a half of older workers have retirement savings think about that you are years of age and youth we can all right how much to retire but because my wages have gone down i have zero in the bank for retirement and at the same time all over america you got millions of seniors and people with disabilities trying to survive on twelve or thirteen thousand dollars a year social security from ramon california older workers are scared to death and they are saying how am i gonna retire with dignity and i wanna love you can get your calculators out not now when you leave you do some arithmetic and try to put yourself in the place of a senior citizen in my state of vermont gets cold in the winter trying to supply pump a year and you tell me how you are going to pay for the food that you need your home and by the medicine that you need and you know what you cant do it today in america nearly million people are living in poverty and over of our children including percent of africanamerican kids are living in poverty the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any nation on earth and what i want you to think about is why is it in the wealthiest country in the history of the world where were seeing the proliferation of millionaires and billionaires we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth today in america million americans have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with outrageously high copayments and deductibles in other words people do have insurance but i talk to people every day i got a deductible although they cant go to the doctor when they need and then on top of that for a wide variety of reasons our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and doctors tell me all of the time we prescribe something i medicine for all patients they cant afford to fill that medicine that prescription one out of five americans cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors right what insanity is that today in america youth unemployment and underemployment is over for africanamerican kids it is over meanwhile we have more people in jail than any other country china communist authoritarian country four times our size we have more people in jail than china and countless lives are being destroyed as we spend eighty billion dollars a year locking up our fellow americans the bottom line is that today in america we not only have massive wealth and income inequality but a power structure built around that inequality which protects those who have the money today a handful of superwealthy campaign contributors have enormous influence over the political process while their lobbyists determine much of what goes on in congress and any member of the united states house or senate who is prepared to tell you the truth will tell you exactly that now in in his state of the union speech president roosevelt outlined what he called a second bill of rights are all familiar with our bill arrives and what roosevelt outline was what he called a second bill of rights this is in my view one of the more importance pitchers ever made by a president but unfortunately it has not gotten the attention that it deserves so im gonna give it some attention today in his remarkable speech this is what roosevelt stated and i quote we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence just sensitive men and we would add women are not free men and women and of course in other words real freedom must include economic security that was roosevelts vision seventy years ago it is my vision today it is a vision that we have not yet achieved and it is time that we did in that speech roosevelt described economic rights are i g h t s writes that he believed every american was entitled to the right to a decent job at the same page the right to adequate food clothing and time off from work the right for every business large and small to function in an atmosphere free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies the right of all americans to have a decent home and decent health care what roosevelt was stating in what martin luther king junior stated in similar terms twenty years later and what i believe today is that true freedom does not occur without economic security people are not free they are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family they are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity they are not truly free when they are unemployed underemployed or when they are exhausted by working hours a week people are not truly free when they dont know how theyre going to get medical help when they or a family member are sick so let me take this opportunity to to find for you simply and straightforwardly what democratic socialism means to me it means building on what franklin delano roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all americans and it builds on what martin luther king junior said in when he stated and i quote this country has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the pool and of course few democratic socialism builds on the success of many other countries around the world who have done a far better job than we have in protecting the deeds of their working families they are elderly citizens their children they are sick and their pool democratic socialism means that we must reform political system which is corrupt that we must create an economy that works law not just the very wealthy democratic socialism to my mind speaks to a system which for example during the nineteen eighties and i want you to hear this allowed wall street to spend by billion dollars over a tenyear period in lobbying and campaign contributions in order to get deregulated they wanted the government of their backs they wanted to do whatever they wanted to do spent five billion dollars over a tenyear period on lobbying and campaign contributions then ten years later after their greed and recklessness and illegal behavior led to their collapse what our system enables them to do is to get bailed out by the united states government which through congress and the fed provided trillions of dollars in aid to wall street in other words wall street use their wealth and power to get congress to do their bidding for deregulation and then when wall street collapse they use their wealth and power to get bailed out quite a system and then to add insult to injury we were told that not only were the banks too big to fail we were told that the bankers were too big to jail this is the system young people who get caught possessing marijuana they get police records and many many hundreds of thousands of them have received police records which have impacted they live in very serious ways on the other hand wall street ceos who helped destroy the economy they dont get police records they get raises in their salaries and this is what dr martin luther king jr meant when he talked about socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else in my view it is time we had democratic socialism for working families doctors for wall street billionaires and large corporations it means that we should not be providing well fail for corporations it means that we should not be providing huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country or trade policies which boost corporate profits while they result in workers losing their jobs it means that we create a government works works for all of the american people not just powerful special interests it means that economic rights must be an essential part of what america stands for among many other things it means that health care should be a right of all people not a privilege i know there are some people out there wasnt this is just a incredibly radical i imagine in the united states of america all of us having health care is a right but i hope all of you know this is not a radical idea it is a conservative idea it is an idea and a practice that exists in every major country on earth you know not just in scandinavia denmark sweden norway it exists in canada i live fifty miles away from canada france germany taiwan all over the world countries have made the determination that all of their people are entitled to health care and i believe the time is long overdue for the united states to join the rest of the world for all singlepayer program which i support would not only guarantee health care for people not only save middleclass families and our entire nation significant sums of money because all of you should know that our health care system is by far the most expensive per capita of any system on earth but a medicare for all singlepayer program would radically improve the lives of all americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy think about it people who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a copayment radical idea when they are sick they can actually go to the doctor and not end up in the emergency room at a much greater expense to the system think about it business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how theyre going to provide health care for their employees think about it and we dont talk about this very much you got millions of workers in this country who are staying on jobs in jobs which they do not want to stay in but they are there because they have a decent health care program for themselves and their families think what it means when young people are anybody else can sell you a lot this is the job of this is what i want to do and im gonna do this work and i dont have to worry about health care because all of us in america have health care and by the way what a medicare for all system will bring about is ending the absurdity of the american people paying by fall the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs now when i talk about democratic socialism what that means to me is that in the year two thousand and a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was fifty years ago and what that means is that public education must today allow every person in this country who have has the ability the qualifications and the desire the right to go to a public college or university tuition free radical socialistic idea i dont think so it exists in many countries all over the world and you know what used to exist in the united states of america we are great universities like university of california the city university of new york virtually tuition free democratic socialism means that our government does everything it can to create a full employment economy it makes far more sense to me to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure then to have a real unemployment rate of almost it is far smaller to invest in jobs and educational opportunities for young people who are unemployed then to lock them up and invest in jails and incarceration products socialism means that a somebody works hours a week that person should not be living in poverty that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage bucks a towel over the next several years it means that we join the rest of the world and pass the very strong paid family and medical leave legislation now sitting in congress think about this want you to see what goes on in our country today its not only that every other major country virtually every country in the world poor countries country reached the conclusion that when a woman has a baby she should not be forced to be separated from that newborn baby after a week or two and have to go back to work making sure that moms and dads can stay home and get to love their babies is a family value that we should support and that is why i want and will fight to end the absurdity of the united states being one of the only countries on earth that does not guarantee at least three months of paid family and medical leave democratic socialism to me means that we have government policy strong government policy which does not allow the greed and profiteering of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet and it means today that we have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren democratic socialism beings that in a democratic civilised society the wealthiest people in the largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes yes innovation entrepreneurial ship and business success should be rewarded by greed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support it is not acceptable to me that in the last period of time last two years fifteen of the wealthiest people in this country fifteen people saw their wealth increase in this room economy by a hundred and seventy billion dollars got it two years fifteen people a hundred and seventy billion dollars increase in there well that is more wealth than is owned by the bottom one hundred and thirty million americans let us not forget what pope francis has so elegantly stated and i quote we have created new idols the worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and thoughtless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly you main goal and the other works weve got to do better than that not a political issue its not an economic issue it is a cultural issue we have got to stop worshiping people make billions and billions and billions of dollars while we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country is not acceptable to me that major corporations stashed their profits in the cayman islands and other tax havens to avoid paying one hundred billion dollars a year in taxes it is not acceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower effective tax rate for nurses or truck drivers it is not acceptable that billionaire families are able to leave virtually all of their wealth to their families without paying a reasonable estate tax it is not acceptable that wall street speculators are able to gamble trillions of dollars in the derivatives market without paying a nickel in taxes on that speculation democratic socialism to me does not just mean that we must create a nation of economic and social justice and environmental saturday of course it does mean that but it also means that we must create a vibrant democracy based on the principle of one person one vote it is extremely safe and i hope all of you will pay a lot of attention to this issue it is extremely sad that the united states one of the oldest most stable democracies in the world has one of the lowest voter turnout of any major country and that millions of young people and working people have given up on the political process entirely in the last midterm election just a year ago sixtythree percent of the american people didnt vote eighty percent of young people did not vote clearly despite the efforts of many republican governors who want to suppress the vote to make it harder for people of color in old people to participate in the political system our job together is to make it easier for people to vote not hard for people to the it is not a radical idea and i will fight for this as hard as i can as president to say that everyone in this country who was years of age or older is registered to vote end of discussion so the next time that you hear be attacked as a socialist like tomorrow remember this i dont believe government should take over the grocery store down the street production but i do believe that the middle class and the working families of this country who produce the wealth of this country deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up not down i do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in america companies that create jobs here rather than companies that are shutting down in america and increasing their profits by exploiting lowwage labor abroad i believe that most americans can pay lower taxes if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the market place finally start paying the taxes that they should i dont believe in special treatment for the top one percent but i do believe in equal treatment for africanamericans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that black lives metal i despise appeals to nativism and prejudice a lot of which we have been hearing in recent months and i do probably believe in immigration reform a pathway to citizenship and a better life while subject let me just say real world of concern to what ive been hearing from some republican candidates for president in recent months people can have honest disagreements about immigration or anything else democracy but people should not be using the political process to inject racism into the debate donald trump and others referred to latinos as people from mexico is criminals and rapists if they want to open that door our job is to shut that door and shut it tight this country has gone to fall too many people have suffered too many people have died for us to continue during races words coming from major political leaders now i dont believe in some foreign is but i do believe in american idealism and one of the pleasures of experience on this campaign so far being here today with you the country huge numbers of young people were coming want to make this country better want to use their intelligence in their energy to address the many problems that we have so i want to thank all of the young people country idealism do not become i am not running for president because it is my turn i was born in a three and a half will apartment in a workingclass family in brooklyn new york i dont think by the way i visited california and seriousness it is quite my turn thats not why im running for president but i am running for president in order for all of us to be able to live in a nation of hope and opportunity not for some but for my seven grandchildren and for all of you nobody understood the connection between american strength at home and our ability to defend america around the world and that is why he proposed a second bill of rights in up any said in that very same state of the union and i quote again americas own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon health fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens for unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace lasting peace in the world and i am not running for president to pursue reckless adventures abroad but to rebuild americas strength at home i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will never send our sons and daughters to war under false pretense or pre cancers about dubious battles with no end in sight and as we discuss foreign policy i know that all of you share with me your shock horror at what happened in paris and you share with me your condolences to the families who lost loved ones in your hopes and prayers that those who were wounded will recover and also those same thoughts go out to the families of those who lost loved ones in the russian like that we believe i was taken down by indices bomb and also those who lost their lives to terrorist attacks in lebanon and elsewhere to my mind it is clear that the united states must pursue policies to destroy the brutal and to create conditions that prevent fanatical extremist ideologies from flourishing but we cannot and should not do it alone our response must begin with an understanding of past mistakes and missteps in our previous approaches to foreign policy it begins with the acknowledgement that unilateral military action should be a last resort not a first resort and illconceived military decisions such as the invasion of iraq can wreak farreaching devastation and destabilization over regions for decades that the found policy decisions of the past russia into war regime change in iraq war toppling mohammad mossadegh in i ran in was the president cia and others got rid of them to protect british petroleum interests the shah of irans came in a brutal dictator and he was thrown out by the islamic revolution and that is where we are and i ran today decisions have consequences orphan unintended consequences so whether it was saddam hussein attack or guatemalan president events in guatemalan brazilian president galore in chilean president salvador allende in this type of regime change this type of throwing overthrowing governments we may not like all thing does not work often makes a bad and difficult decision even worse these are lessons we must learn after world war ww in response to the fear of soviet aggression european nations and the united states established nato the north american treaty organization an organization based on shared interests and goals and the notion of a collective defense against a common enemy it is my belief that we must expand on these ideals and solidify our commitments to work together to combat the global threat of terror we must create a new organization like nato to confront the security threats of the st century and organization that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration to defeat the rise of violent extremism any importantly to address the root causes on the line these brutal acts we must work with our nato partners we must work to expand the coalition with russia and we must work with members of the arab league but let us be very clear while the united states and other western nations how bush strength of our military and our political systems the fight against isis is a struggle for the soul of islam and countering violent extremism and destroying isis must be drawn primarily by muslim nations with the strong support of their global partners long before paris but i am very happy to tell you that these same sentiments have been echoed by people like jordans king abdullah the second in a speech just sunday in which he said that terrorism is the greatest threat to our region the gulf region middle east and that muslims must lead the fight against he noted that confronting extremism is both a regional and international responsibilities and that it is incumbent on muslim nations and communities to confront those who seek to hijack their societies and their religion with generations of intolerance and violent ideology and let me congratulate king abdullah not only for his wise remarks but also for the role that his small country is playing only for his wise remarks but also for the role that his small country is playing in attempting to address the horrific to combat isis to seal the borders that fighters are currently flowing across to share counterterrorism intelligence to turn off the spigot of terrorist financing endtoend support for exploiting extremist ideologies and what does that mean what it means is that in many cases we must ask more from those countries in the gulf region while jordan turkey egypt and lebanon in their own ways have accepted their responsibilities for taking in syrian refugees other countries in the region have done nothing or very little equally important and this is a point that may make some people uncomfortable but it is a client that must be made countries in the region like saudi arabia kuwait qatar the uae countries of enormous wealth and resources have contributed far too little in the fight against isis that must change absolutely right when he says the muslim nations must lead the fight against and that includes and must include some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region to this point have done too little saudi arabia turns out has the third largest defense budget in the world yet instead of fighting i says they are focused more on a campaign to oust i ran back hootie rebels in yemen kuwait a country whose ruling family was restored to power by the united states driving saddam husseins iraq out of kuwait has been a wellknown kuwait people in kuwait have been well known sources of financing for isis and other violent extremists it has been reported the cutoff will spend up to two hundred billion dollars on the and world cup including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event billion on hosting a soccer event yet very little to fight isis were still it has been widely reported that the government there has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing and the qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups in the region all this has got to change wealthy and powerful muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the united states our young men in women and our taxpayers to do it for them they have got to come up to the plate as we develop a strongly coordinated effort we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against isis takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that handful the kind of cooperation that we desperately need further we all understand that bashar alassad president of syria is a brutal dictator who has lauded many of his own people i am pleased that we saw last weekend diplomats from all over the world known as the international serious support group set a timetable for a syrianled political transition with an open and fair election these are the promising beginnings of a collective effort to end the bloodshed and move toward a political transition in syria the double up diplomatic plan for assad transition from paula is a good step in a united front but our major priority must be to defeat isis nations all over the world who share a common interest in protecting themselves against international terrorism must make the destruction of isis the highest priority nations in the region must admit that instead of turning a blind eye they will commit their resources to preventing the free flow of terrorists financials and fighters to syria and iraq we need a commitment that they will count the violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism river that often occurs within their borders this is the model which we must pursue in order to address the global threats that we face while individual donations obviously have historic dispute the united states and russia now very strong differences of opinion on some very serious issues i ran in saudi arabia to put it mildly do not like each other but the time is now to do everything possible to put aside those differences to work toward a common goal of destroying isis sadly as we have seen recently no country is immune from attacks by the violent organization called isis does we must work with our partners in europe the gulf region africa and southeast asia all along the way asking the hard questions whether their actions are serving how unified purpose the bottom line is that i says must be destroyed but it cannot be defeated by the united states alone a new and effective coalition must be formed with the muslim nations leading the effort on the ground while the united states and other major forces provide the support they need let me conclude once again thanking all of you for being here today all across this country is elimination from the political process people look to washington and they throw their hands up and they say what in gods name is going on there why you are into our senators and congressmen paying attention to our needs why are we developing a rational farm policy rather than talking again about getting involved in the middle east which could lead to perpetual conclude just by saying this the problems that we face as a nation are indeed very very serious like talk talk talk on some theres a lot we havent even touched upon but by in large all of these problems were caused by bad human decisions if we come together if we stand together if we do not allow ourselves to be divided up by race by whether we gave weather wish rate was born in america we werent born in america whether a male or female if we stand together and if we focus on how we can create same foreign policy how we can rebuild the middle class how we can combat climate change how we can create a nation in which we end racism and homophobia if we are prepared to do that if you as young people are prepared to engage in the political process i have no doubt that there is nothing nothing nothing that together we cannot accomplish thank you all very muchtheir special claim to fame with not just that they produced a fantastic ice cream and dozens of weird flavors but that they were also great employers supporters obermeyer agriculture in champions of the environment ben jerrys show the world that one could be a successful and profitable company while at the same time maintaining progressive ideals in recent years enduring have been increasingly concerned about the power of big money in politics and what its doing to our democracy please welcome back cohen and jerry greenfield uh the the the one and honor ford van and me to be here supporting bernie sanders a man who for all over thirty years has been fighting for fairness and against injustice and i feel so lucky and millions of americans across the country are lucky that we can now join bernie in this fight the you know frontrunner business as usual politics from either party is just more of the same more money for the ultrawealthy and nice for everybody else more profits for oil companies and less clean air debris more money for jails and defense contractors and pharmaceutical companies and less money for schools lifting people out of poverty and creating a healthier society both physically and spiritually this system isnt broken it fixed its great its no accident that corporate profits through through the room while wages are stagnant its no accident that ninety percent of the wealth created in the last five years has gone to the top one percent the laws are written by politicians to please the corporations and the ultrawealthy who bought those politicians with millions of dollars up socalled political campaign contributions otherwise known as legalized bribery the and bernie s led the fight to put an end to it unlike some johnnycomelately stew the issues bernie is the real thing uh hes not about reading the polls and figuring out what he needs to say in order to get elected he said now and unwavering commitment to basic justice a quality and sound financial sets the i mean the guys been saying and doing the same stuff for the last thirty years in if he werent so inspiring hed be pouring hes about leading with his heart and his soul and using his brain to do whats best for the little guy the guy who is ignored by the political elite until its time to ask for their book you know some say that voting for bernie is throwing your vote away uh i they say that voting for anyone else is flushing our country down the drain uh the the and you know sometimes the underdog links in the early days depending jerry when we were barely available outside firm are the pillsbury corporation owners have haagen dazs were illegally trying to put us out of business we couldnt afford to fight them in court but we took our case to the people an appeal to their sense of fairness and one uh and the country found out what the doughboy i was afraid this is a guy with the vision and that got sent the smarts to return america to what made our country great in the first place for those who have been sitting on the sidelines finally a candidate worth voting for the and you know what if we all get all of our butts and work for any bernie will def by the experts once again and hell wear the the you know in the end theres a spiritual dimension to all this as tracy chapman saying hunger for a tasty justice hunger only for a world that truth costs all that you have

issues then i will be focusing on in the coming month and then give you a brief outline arbitrage and up for america up and agenda which in fact will deal with the serious problems and lead us to a better future today today we live in a nation which is the wealthiest nation in the history of the world what got reality means very little for most robust because almost all of that wealth is owned and controlled by a tiny handful of individuals in america we now have wat income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth and the gap between not very rich should everyone else if growing wider ny the airshow while and income inequality is for great moral issue of our time it is for greater economic issue of our time it is for great political issue all about im and we well address it uh and like me be very clear and let the clock percent understand this there is something profoundly wrong when the top up percent owns own both of us much well ever bottom ninety percent and when ninetynine percent all no income go through the top what percent there is something profoundly wrong where in recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same time x millions of americans are working longer hours polo wagers and we have shamefully the highest rate our childhood poverty of any major country there is something profoundly wrong went family one family all swallow wealth in this country than the bottom million americans this grotesque level update equality is the moral it is bad economics it is unsustainable this type of wreck the economy if not what america is supposed to be about this has got to change and as your president took cab up we are going to change it one its not just income and wealth inequality it is a tragic reality that for the last forty years great middleclass about country nv up the entire world has been disappearing despite exploding technology and increased worker productivity median family income is almost five thousand dollars less today that it was in in our great state and all over this country people are working not one drop but to drop three jobs trying to cobble together any car and some healthcare back is not acceptable we can inbox do better the truth theres the real unemployment is not percent what you read in the papers it is close to percent youth unemployment seventy percent africanamerican youth unemployment of but rocks today shamefully we are million people living in poverty many of whom are working and lowwage job in america today despite the gains of the affordable care act million americans still lack any help injured my friends diana is the reality uppermiddleclass in america today and not is a reality not just for our what for our kids and our grandchildren that we are going to change my fellow americans love me as want be as blunt as i can and tell you what you already know as a result other disastrous supreme court decision im citizens united the american political system has been totally corrupted and the foundations of american democracy on now being undermine what the supreme court said sexually was that it was not good enough with the billionaires own march up the economy they could now all the united states government as well and that is precisely what they are trying to do now when i learned in school and i they quickly many women who put their lives on the line to defend our country have long know that american democracy is not about billionaires being able to buy candidates and by election it is thought about the koch brothers sheldon adelson and other incredibly wealthy individuals spending billions of dollars to elect candidates who will make the rich richer and everyone else poor according to media reports that you cant believe it the koch brothers in this election cycle are prepared to spend more money but i believe the democratic or republican partys that is not democracy that is oligarchy in vermont throughout town meetings we know what democracy is about that as one person onevote and not for karnal political system we are going to fight law and are going to achieve now when we talk about our responsibilities as human beings that as per theres nothing more important leaving this country and the entire planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and our grandchildren but the bay is over scientific community has spoken in a virtually unanimous boys climate change is real it is caused by human activity and is already causing devastating problems in our country and around the world and lets be clear if we do not get our act together and happy united slates leave the world in combat in climate change there will be a boy drowned more famine more rising sea level wat wud warm ocean acidification more extreme weather disturbances airs human being will work out all well this environment who appreciate the beauty that we have on this planet we are not going to allow a fossil fuel industry the detroit their line out brothers and sisters it is no secret that there is massive discontent with politics in america today in the last picture malek should some percent of americans did not bowl including eighty percent young people poll after poll tells of that all citizens no longer have confidence in our political institutions and given the power a bigmoney in the political process in general they understand that their pain is not being heard washing and that people in washington elected official much wat concern about the lobbyists and the billionaire the suffering ordinary now combat ng this political alienation this it is and this legitimate angle will not be easy thats for sure but that is exactly what gavel we machst du if were going to turn this country around and that is what this campaign is all about and if we are going to bring people together we need a simple straightforward progressive agenda which speaks to the need up the american people and provide software a vision are they very different america and what his father john let me briefly tell you when i think the agenda begins with job job and more jobs if we are serious about reversing the client the middle class we need a may drop federal jobs program which put millions of people back to work a good paying jobs at a time when our roads our bridges our water system rail and airport of the caning about the fact that way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and that is why i introduce legislation which would at best one trillion dollars over five years to modernize our countrys physical infrastructure of legislation that would create and maintain third she million goodpaying jobs and if youre president i will lead the effort to make sure what that legislation this past i will also continue to oppose our current trade policy what de que presidents from both parties have supported trade agreements which are poor start million up decent paying jobs as corporate america shot down plants in vermont throughout this country and moves to lowwage country as president might trade policies will break not cycle of agreements which rich but few at the expense up too many lot of also be on earth and acknowledge that today million of american workers on now working poor totally inadequate wages the car in federal minimum wage up seven and a quarter now are is a start they should wage and mark be raised not minimum wage in this country marked bcom a living wage which be which believes raising it the fifteen dollars an hour over the next few years old our goal not a radical idea when our goal must be that any worker in this country who worked hours a week is not living in poverty burgaw we must stop large pay equity for women workers it is unconscionable that women earn cents on the dollar compared to men will perform the same work we must also revived our overtime standards so that people people make it with now a year who are working hours a week get time and a half and and we need paid sick leave and guaranteed vacation time for every worker in this country this campaign starting today is going to send a message the billionaire class and that is you cant have it all you cant get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry you cant continue sending out job abroad wild million are looking for work you cant hide your property in the cayman islands and other tax havens while they are on math look unmet needs on every corner up this nation total billion a class of i save that your degree has got to end you cannot take advantage all of the benefits america up if you refuse to accept your responsibilities and ideas why we need a tax system which is fair and progresso which counsel wealthiest individuals and the largest corporations that they are going to begin to start paying their fair share our our taxes when we talk about power we talk about wall street in my view it is time to break up the largest financial institutions in this country wall street cannot continue to be an island unto itself gambling trillion in risky financial instruments while expecting the public the bail in ill if a bank is too big to fail that bank is topiary to accept if we are serious about a progressive agenda that speaks to the d of working families their talks about climate change and the needs about kids and the elderly we marked be focused on campaign finance reform and a needed break constitutional amendment to overturn their interest citizens united decision i am said it before and ill say it again i will not nominate any justice the supreme court who else not made it clear that he or she will mu to overturn that this actress position which is on the binding american democracy longerterm we need to go further in a stylish public funding on election i look to our future it is clear to me that the united states of america month leave the world in reversing climate change weekend do not like transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels for energy efficiency and thought sustainable energy use when so solar geothermal and biomass brothers and sisters the united states of america today remains the only major country on earth but does not guarantee health care to all people as the right despite the modest gains of the affordable care act million americans continue to have no health insurance an even more are under insurer yet despite that pathetic record we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care is any all about nation in march strong a pic united states march drawing the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a right in and we both stored through a medicare for all singlepayer program out at a time when millions of americans are struggling to keep their heads above water economically and a time when senior poverty is increasing at a time when millions of kids in this country dont get enough food the my republican colleagues as part of their recently passed budget are trying to make a terrible situation even worth if you can believe it and this is the true the republican budget rose million americans awkward health insurance makes drastic cuts in medicare growth billion lowincome americans including pregnant women of good nutrition programs and makes it hard on stroke and makes it horrible workingclass families to afford college or put their kids in the head start program and then to add insult to injury the republican budget provides you tax breaks for the very richest people in this country while they raise taxes on working family well let me tell my republican colleagues that i respectfully disagree with their approach uh instead of cutting social security we are going to expand social security card uh instead of cutting head start and child care we are going to move to a universal prek system for all the children of this country as franklin delano roosevelt reminded of a nations greatness is george not quite what it provides to the most welloff wonder how it treats the people most indy and dodi is what kind of country we must become uh and when we talk about education let me make it very clear in a highly competitive global economy we need the best educated workforce we can create it is insane it is counterproductive to the best interests of our country that of thousands up right young people can not up lloyd to go to college and that millions of others leave school with a mountain of debt that burden them put back in this is not what a great country its about that most and not its why i as president well fight to make to were sure in in public colleges and universities free uh as well as substantially lower interest rates one student loans and the young people all over our country our book young chop theyve gotta get the education they need uh as everybody knows we live in a difficult and dangerous world and there are people out there who would do us harm as president i will defend this nation but i will do it responsibly as a member of congress i voted against the war in iraq and i walked alright bro uh i am vigorously oppose to enlist perpetual walk in the middle east yes we must be vigorous and calm banning terrorism and the feeding ices but we as a nation should not have to bear that burden alone we must be part of an international coalition led by the muslim nations that could not only to be like this but begin the process up creating conditions well last week please out as some love you know i was born in a faraway land called brooklyn new york my father came to this country from poland without a penny in his pocket and having dropped out a school at a young age my mother graduated high school in new

with congress has seen the probe boy months after years with a team of mandatory sentence i see the board in eighteen months and they told me i dont have enough time so they said we might see next year i wrote them and say thank you give me the opportunity i understand have years and maybe ill be satisfied with his eighteen months however i will see you again and i will continue doing the things that happened i seen here they ask me a question is very important question is that the senator from ohio had he said why should we let you go home and i say because of still useful please do not put me inside the warehouse on a show and let me say i am useful i can use my experiences that all good to help those who unfortunately may be traveling the way that i have traveled five years later i am now in my master degree in drake i dropped out it is great in and gary g the new york state penitentiary and now again i mean my masters degree that most of family members are incarcerated in the apt to go through workrelease probably would be forced to me and when you go to morning they give you piece of paper and they tell you to go find a job thats all they do well i havent been used the penitentiary three here again and in those three years i have been to a lot of things and i had to learn how to deal with with no help so ive learned how to do with myself without those reports that the senators were mentioning a prob be back and i did have been exports i own my own agency no reason why all my own agencies because nobody would give me a job and my job to do something thats behavior helping to ensure i have been apparent partner for those who dont know that i was a people who help other people who have lost eight children because of drugs of choice for them to jump through hoops at the ages and do what they need to do to get the children i feel great all those things in those things keep me free i believe that if you give somebody the opportunity to serve special just coming out the attack that opportunity and a lot of them will stay we wont see all this going back with dad im gonna pass it on to senator thank you very much the attack very much very honored to introduce rueben johnson rubin similar way to draw has also experienced the inside of a penitentiary please welcome rueben johnson thank you are a lot of cases a lot of cases that does not exist does not exist unless you have some family support unless you have some gentleman who have been in prison i can speak directly to you about their experiences nine times out of they have nothing to speak about my experience when i left the jury in illinois i was released from joliet state penitentiary the day before i was released i did not know i was going to be released had no idea so someone finally came to my cell said packaged up you going home great exciting im wondering what the next steps will be driving those next steps so when im when i get released i get taken to the front door of the state prison to await my ride they give me a time believed it had and perhaps and that was it was a little late they tell me to sit on a bench and weight i didnt know what to expect yet i was expecting something in my mind i was like should i be getting something is there no paperwork steps and i need to follow when i get back out nothing my brother comes to pick me up his unlicensed driver hes x fell when i get in the car he has marijuana and drink for me congratulations glad you home lets party unfortunately i am impoverish i have to go back to my home my friends these are my friends they say man im glad youre home and it went to give me things during legal to allow me to get some money so that they say you get back on your feet these are my friends enforcing this all i had available to me at that point thats not what i wanted but i didnt know where else to look i felt as if i should want something else but i didnt know where else to look site so here i kinda expected i would be released i went to see the parole board similar and in the parole board meeting they have a list of questions that they typically action and these are list of questions that they axe everybody different cases different demographics different understandings different backgrounds questions for everybody eventually because i may be in the questions so i asked the crisis in the manner in which to parole officers and their grandma perot thats not to say i hadnt changed i had learned anything why did learn something i learned what they wanted to hear when they ask these questions any benefit me so i was able to be released from prison while i was in prison have programs that you must be a part of your response but when im in prison to those programs is to show i have to show up and sign my name that i was here from that point i could fall asleep the instructor does not work in the prison he has no responsibility whatsoever to ensure that i follow this program or even learn from the program hes being paid to show up and facilitated class and he does that to my understanding probably doesnt work out ill probably he does it well so i didnt gathered that much from that idea gained something that i found out about it gathered that much from that so apparent in the granite to perot to be released account like the same thing happened over again im expecting something i feel like something soon happen so they tell me im going to work release center he mentioned in its support to more like okay so i understand that there will be a little bit more development maybe some skills training if you will i dont know but no not not not at all you get there you have to establish a banking account because they want to keep track and manage your money for you theyre nice that way they will also give you the piece of paper that he mentioned where you must go out and you find a job now kinda like whats wrong said whats wrong came out me and him and i was able to assist him with finest employment that he became successful way i was able to develop him to the point where he was able to run off on his own to find that development thats almost was my expect expectation in this work release center but thats not what they do again theyll just give you this piece of paper and they require you to go out and get that job i was not from the morni why do i knew nothing about the morning i was a really didnt have them when i want free and i didnt know where employers was i didnt even have work experience on my resume is gonna be takin it had dropped out of school so i dont have a full level of education either if not for a friend of mine who happened to be incarcerated telling me you know they hired me over here and theyre still hiring theyd like us you need to come out here so i went out there the interview process is very simple probably could they just want to feel cease to try to feel their fulltime employee quota and i met that so they hired me but if not for that gentleman introducing me to that i would not have had that opportunity but it turns out is the same employment opportunity talked about and we made it a point to go out and seek individuals who were just recently let out of prison who didnt have many skills are many educational opportunities and we brought them in right i wont take up too much more determined to make sure you maybe you actually later on but throughout my time was released from prison in and to this day i have a receipt of aidid im proud of that i havent even thought about that thank you thank you i appreciate it thats my job thats what i should be doing but throughout that time i have met and i cannot even count among my hand how many im no one special but i have meant i cant count among my hand without roughly see about different male individuals who if i hadnt had the experiences that i had to make me a little upset angry and i want to make sure that this gentleman doesnt go to that either theyre about roughly to individuals who have have felony records in our model was supposed to socialize with wife had given them an opportunity in their life today they have never been back to prison want their gainfully employed summer pursuing her masters degrees in college i mean theyre making so many improvements theyre getting married theyre not even running the streets in that type of matter anymore some of cannot drink some of stop drinking i dont take credit for it what i do know is i gave them the motivation to be able to pursue their dreams in a manner however legally this was something that i was not supposed to be able to do legally this was something that i was not supposed to do i want you guys to think about that if this young lady accidentally makes a mistake in her life and they consider it fell in felonious a felon she is removed as a resource from just about everybody else in this room if we were and i dont think thats fair because i know she has something and ill be able to benefit from something thatll be able to impact my life what does that mean we are giving back to our community were giving back to our families were giving back to our country in this particular manner thats all i have a will take up too much time thank you guys for allow me to come here and speak in this manner but i do hope that this allows us to open on my open our eyes to the demographic that we are singling out were targeting i understand that theyre criminals out there need to be in prison but we have to make sure were doing our weights and balances we get the right people in the right places a long speech what i want to do is open let me throw out some questions that maybe we may want to think about why is it that in america we have so many people in jail number one why is it disproportionately black and brown what are some of the laws out there minimum sentencing socalled war on drugs what impact does all of that house on the high rates of incarceration in america are we doing anything close to what we should be doing in terms of dealing with high rates of recidivism in other words you heard both of these guys talking about you know when you come out of jail is there a path is there other programs available to help you get your feet back on the ground or you simply given a piece of paper and save bucks and good luck to you and if thats the case why is not surprising that so many people end up back in jail so those are just some of the issues that come to the top of my my other issues out there that we didnt talk about art and im the former chairman its interest former chairman of the senate veterans committee and in somehow i think theres some kind of correlations a relationship with people come home for what about the wives girlfriends in the children how they impact on this whole process that were the talk about what percentage of kids whose parents are in jail with themselves end up in jail the answer is obviously its a very very high percentage but if dad is arrested in goes the job of the family so some of my questions are you have other questions lets open up so just introduce yourself be as loud as you can only hope michael cedar rapids hold up my clothes over there we we welcome you and your guests here today one of the questions that came up to us while we were just sitting here is what about having the voting rights restored to think about and i have the numbers varied here in my speech but ill give it over to draw well governor we all make mistakes and makes worst mistakes and others and if a person has proved to be able to think now more productive way i think certain rights should be restored so they can be a full citizen of this country we have a lot to offer i mean right now as secondclass citizens thats something that will make me hope you know able to do the things i do when i have came as far as i came in five years because i have a purpose other purpose than anybody x card beautiful person for the job of a life happens when you retire you know lost like leader purpose right so helping allow us to help this is democracy that we have will help us feel like part in that outside inside the lawn outside outlaws enough anyone thinks by the way just like to point out that almost made the main point you did you time to time you saw it why should that crime take away your right to participate in american democracy now there are states like my by the way with the limbs to vote and we have got to make that universal people have paid their price but that does not mean they should not be able to participate in the democratic system very very good question are at four percent of people in jails and prisons have some sort of mental health challenge and you mentioned earlier that is a word that we dont like to talk about mental health is something that is a huge contributing factor to people ending up in jails and prisons and especially in the state of iowa we just closed two of our mental health facilities i know the governor would like to close a third and when people have nowhere to go for mental health treatment often times they end up in jail or prison so to the point right away absolutely great our time and ask these guys need a job as well mental health issues people behind bars whats the correlation whats the speakers speaking about the africanamerican community and other minority communities go to something that is has always been somewhat downplayed region to be very secretive far as thats concerned access ability to get to a mental health facility is another thing that might interfere with a person getting that so most minorities do get their medical treatment while incarcerated in the treatment they learn how to deal with it come home we maybe six months worth of medication if they have medication and so we dont have no rights to go back in they call themselves and some medicated so we have some services that connects from the penitentiary to society rubin hansen and im going to ask you guys to think about what percentage of people i dont know of anyone does but what percentage of people behind bars in fact or medicated is there a lot of medicine i dont know too much about the mental health in a clinical diagnosis would have to be honest with you im skeptical of it i know its used as a tool is its its especially for younger people thats when they started out you know about his nose you with a problem right here i guess thats the reason why im sending you to prison later on down the line you cant learn your enable to change theres you have issues you have mental health lets go ahead and get him incarcerated because before you get incarcerated as they so you dream that theres rehabilitation is true but there seem to be able to address once youre incarcerated not troops are they going to what youre talking about thats where the medication comes in it im the doctor in the prison its a prison its really big i got a lot of people who were considered clinically or mental health issues where i would rather just medicate some that i dont want to deal with no service on that i do so the medication rate is high so you end up coming out of prison and i need to sustain bed so that i dont want some of the people in prison or on that occasion yes and when they got out of prison what happens when they get out of prison that medication becomes more to the financial room now theres a huge benefit and its so particularly probably cant afford it right so you go to the alternative i dont know you know if you pay attention to the news of you do studies right they go from prescribe medication that makes you feel some type of way to go find that drugs on the street so whether its something to make you feel relaxed michael find marijuana heroin but something made you feel hyper you might go find cocaine or whatever the case may be right so its just again the coping mechanism whether its mental help with this guy that was in prison with the guy that doesnt have support whatever you going to try to find what you can do to cope because theres nothing out here to help you plotted it is the gap right because again they just let you out its not i let you out in the visa services going around right so we can make sure that you still at which helps the person who just came out of it provides jobs for individuals things that i let me jump in and ask a question rubins those tell me if i got it right let you how was bucks right ok bucks many people who get out have been receiving medication in jail in a limited amount money you dont have a job you may not have job training and yep im about the suite of it is i represented as a significant amount of money as individual to the prison complex and they are determined to get their money so even when youre out you owe them their money they typically say restitution they might see a state like your paper you paid your paper you eventually you pay for the medication that you were giving them their you pay for all the services you pay for the treatment but it is not itemized on that building just lumped into one socalled restitution if you will and has not taken off you will you like just getting out of jail without a job but in the uk for supervision so yeah right assumption that you have the doesnt matter who you guys know this is my only person was rumored into this if you go to polk county stake in its contractual so they give you piece of paper that you sign your name or nickname i can we take what happens you will be charged but you probably wont go to write you probably be paid because thats what they need to do but you might just get along art so what were hearing is your lease no job no source of income bucks maybe in your pocket you may be on medications which have created a certain feeling in you that youre going to have to deal with the outside and on top of that money nobody like you had a case manager say every x every person is about to leave out a statement attributable to each entry had a case manager that person would be somebody there to organize these services around that one person is no money in the mail and we have to come to grips with that in the question about mental health and im so glad that the young lady brought that up most of the women and we have to talk about women in the sisters who are in prison right now most women are nonviolent offenders as well so were locking them up many of them not all because we need to care about single women as well as single men and women dont have children but then just think about the women who do have children i will compounding that because lots of homes especially in poor communities and especially in africanamerican communities are single mother here household over of the mama is locked up where are the resources for the children but to her mental health point lots of women are on that mental health track and they dont have the support that they need when they come out so we should not be surprised and im with you tsunami that the charging of folks but we should not be surprised as a nation we know that the system itself is is is created to help them go back to prison really is so your point senator about i hope youll talk about that taken away to profit doing away with core profit let me just pick up on the point that senator tournament animal open it up i think this one is a no brainer we have introduced legislation corporations should not be profiteering through the incarceration of fellow americans and the discussion from cedar rapids and in my neighborhood its percent black its not for and i agree with everything people are saying but i still dont think were talking about the white elephant in the room which is over half of our prison population is there for nonviolent drug offenses you cant solve a problem if you continue to throw people in prison for doing nothing hurts anybody but themselves and in most cases doesnt hurt themselves what we have is gutless politicians who wont stand up and say were on drugs is a complete and total failure in needs to stop now questions right many of you may not get the federal level at the federal level we have controlled substance act this is federal war with rocks right now on schedule you have heroin and alongside her when you got marijuana that makes sense that he is introduced legislation that takes marijuana completely out of the controlled substances act is a federal crime i really like going to the kind you places like how you do it away you know you cant get a job we go back to the same old thing i was talking about the war on drugs when a police record means of things hell want to say a word proud of being black there and then all of a sudden i dont know were in my mind becomes crack cocaine and yes it was my choice you know but i wasnt warned about you know when that time it was ok you know so we tried and that was it and i know people today who was still underneath that same illusion from the eighties still chasing that same fortunately our children they dont do it because they see how to fix does but its still a whole generation of experience that could have been given granted to the babies that were behind us and im very angry about the reasons why i did pick being a drug counselor so that i can help that type of situation because honestly we allow some of course to race ibm black brown white whatever to color with a record of service to everybody has something to think about me years in the penitentiary i changed my life the fact i change my life i change over peoples i have declined i do with white black yellow pages of and if it wasnt for me change my life being doles opportunities i was able to grasp what i couldnt help this so we hope it helps everybody you helping us everybody all the questions i spent some time working with foster care youth aged to it was a mentoring program for kids it was a voluntary program so they didnt they had to have a caseworker but they didnt have to work with our program but it was an incentives based program so if they met goals they could receive incentives and it was a government program so we worked at the department of human services and it was a really great program and it was pretty well funded and i felt like we had a lot of success with the kids that were willing to come work with us but the day they turn theyre no longer eligible for any of those services and percentage of former foster care youth who end up homeless at some point in their lives over half in many states the percentage of former foster care youth that end up in prison like where the number of inmates who are former foster care youth is over half in most states and im just curious what we can do as a society to help change our perspective that when someone is that they deserve our support they deserve access to mental health care services they deserve adults who are there as their mentors or people who have his wide access to services professional services but always then when theyre theyre supposed to have all their lives together they dont have a support network if they havent built it through the professionals that have been working with them if they dont have it in them to make it i i dont know what the answer is but theyre still clearly this funneling of of kids who grew up without the support that they need it oftentimes children of people who have been incarcerated and then end up in the system sometimes successful system sometimes unsuccessful system but regardless whether then its just cut off i think through a slot and give it to the panel as well we have by the way exactly the same problem for most likely the same as the society what we have got to establish be clear about is what our priorities are is some kind of magical number so im still struggling when i am trying to do the right thing right trying to get my feet on the ground doesnt make any sense in the world because of the magical number of points that you pull the rug out from under those kids and take away the support system that has kept them alive and a whole bunch of their lives frankly im gonna tell us which is not necessarily relevant to your question but it talks about what we can do what we want to do it southern part of my state there was a principal of a high school this woman was virtually but not about determining the kids will not drop out of high school hard determination was the kids were not going to slip through the cracks and throughout our society thats what happens billions of times people slip through the cracks who gives a damn about that case she gave a damn about every kid in school she hired mentors you know what the mendes da bus kids can call up that mentor at three oclock in the morning if theres a fight between your parents or bad things are happening you call up the metro at three oclock in the morning and she or he will be there for you you are not going to drop out of school because we love you and because were concerned about your future and she had an extraordinarily positive result in terms of keeping people from dropping out of school getting jobs but they did it helping them financially helping them get the college if that was their goal thats the bottom line the bottom line is we now what has to be done they are always so i come from a family where my dad came to this country age of without a nickel in his pocket he dropped out of school never had much education my brother graduated high school that was it i want the college frankly i was a little bit + hang around with lawyers kids business people skills the doctors kids was very insecure about that this program out there soon return id like you know it the trio program you know what they do they say to kids walk what ten youre not you want to go to college willing to work with you within a two year college campus in a scary thought is anybody else even if those are the kids up money and your family does not have an extraordinary really successful record whats the bottom line the bottom line is we now in many cases what has to be done to crush the news putting the resources into doing what has to be done not wanting to punish people wanted to say hey youre youre out on your own now good luck youll hear bucks youre out of jail you can do it if we want to make sure that what the kids the well we know how to do it if we want to make sure that people who released from jail do not go back to jail we know how to do that as well comments schools and in some way we can connect the school school should know the condition of every child in skul they are the foundation because every child in this country has to go to school so there to answer a community safety net is an answer as well you know age aint nothing but a number as as they say it really is and my son who is a police officer he just turned he is independent but hes not because i mama you know and hes fortunate enough to have a mother and a father does not go beyond him all the time even though we raised him right he had a period of time especially during the great recession after he graduated with young folks couldnt college degrees but he was fortunate enough to have two parents who can catch a lot of children dont have that whether foster children are not absolute right we have a throwaway mentality in the society if children dont fit a mold we throw them away so i believe that the school system though is the key because theyre the foundation to catch all the children the ballot box can i just say that because when we elect people in the elected ministry who care about the folks they were elected to serve then we can have policies back to senator sanders point that will do the things that we need to have done you cannot be fun programs like that and then expect these children to be okay you cant be fined or close down mental health institutions and think that people are going to be okay you cant collect amounts of money off the backs of people who have fallen on hard times in this country and think that things are going to be ok you know im a college professor as well as i know that trio program very will on the first day of class i usually ask us to do what they want to be when they grow up and it doesnt matter if the or at their my class if you are living you should have a dream in a vision for your life and i have yet to have one of my students a to follow us attorney when i grow up i want to be poor or when i want to go to prison thats the life for me im looking forward to this journey everybody has a dream with somehow along the way it is snuffed out by assads he debt does not clear if we could just have some compassion and empathy but then elect folks senators and to say give a damn i want to say let people give a shit douglas once and not quoting him exactly but he said something along these lines that is a better investment to invest in children in broken mean and that is what we have to do we can start right there but the school system the school system is the best institutional answer that we had just im a proud progressive but any conservative out there should be listening to senator turner promising as well because the evidence is overwhelming that when you invest in the children when you invest in the services when make sure the kids get a good education or a good job you save substantial sums of money to the university of iowa is a hell of alot cheaper that given them up and tell young lady talk i have my son my son is running track schools drive and i think thats very important as a parent partner again apparently theres a person who is a role model for individuals already have been going to dhs issues now they have and as a parent pointblank noticed a regardless of what society says it does most likely most likely the child i dont kids one year after two years after two years after i know young man has placements and his twenty oneyearold they cut him off he found his mom and put me with that jail and with my son you know the children want to be with his parents so lets look at the same with lost a parent a rights come home and theyre in contact with the force to cure her sin city not a doctors say theyre still in foster care in this person shows for an adequate amount of time that they able to function in our society in the mannerisms which is appropriate questions im right here im actually go but i go to school rapids so i grew up why mexicanamerican and so i grew up we dont have cable or anything this has a point i promise and so so i want a lot of like a pbs and whatnot and so i remember growing up most of the characters i mean i know their animals but like most of the characters i assumed a white and so like growing up it was kind of hard to believe myself and so i was wondering if theres any way that we can make like public broadcasting television and legal you require adversity and not just one character for me traes protagonist of various races and stuff like that so thatd be nice im gonna give his campaign but ive been talking about is my fears that economically we are moving toward an oligarchic former society where a small number of very very wealthy people are receiving today almost all of the new income in the new wealth politically i worry that as a result of citizens united billion as of buying elections but it also worried about the media billion raises an issue issue this is what i worry about i think you can watch television and not get a feeling that what you see is the reality of american life in many respects youre talking about race relations in a sense united people of your background on television okay what im talking about also and then return them at this point a moment ago we just came out of the worst economic downtown downturn in the modern history of this country since the great depression millions of people walk their draws millions of people lost their homes millions of people lost their life savings the day in america you have a middle class which is disappearing you have in some cases peoples life expectancy going down massive despair reflected on television is the reality of america reflected in the struggles that people are making half of the people years of age or older up to savings for retirement that at seven years of age you got nothing in the bank how do you think you feel youre scared to talk about it nbc abc soap operas so much not so much so your point is right and i agree with you but its easy deeper than that we are a country where millions of people are in despair black white they want to see your reflection of their realities in media and in many respects they are not in na say who the hell is talking about my life who knows about my life why should i vote nobody cares about nobody even knows whats going on in my life so media becomes a very important part of the reality of american i think we need some big changes that anyone want to do that part of how things are how were losing control as a country is that we are at each others throats i think that theres a lot of different brands that we tend to fall under the sooners talking about pretty much in what is pretty much effect is more than anything else in my belief is classes are being one another for one reason or another so that we cannot come together and figure out what needs to be done while those who are supposedly sitting above economic coup culpability looking and plotting how can we keep them confuse so we can keep making however i also know that those issues my royalty passed the senate see that might just be a first talked about that worry about that wow they were they maybe i still plotting and planning to confuse from just very profound point just pick up on it want you to hear this in america today the top one tenth of one percent not owns almost as much wealth as the bottom wealthiest people in this country to people on more wealth than the bottom of the american people hundred and fifty million people percent of all new income generated today is going to the top you seen on tv likely not too much and whats wrong i rather have us fighting against each other and black and brown and white gay and straight youre born in mexico youre born in america well with mexico but lets talk about that lets not talk about how we come together to create an economy that works well rather than the top one percent everybody who are real american heroes are about i cannot begin to imagine the kind of strength that was required to transform their lives and to make the point that what they want to do with their lives and what makes them stronger human beings is actually help other people i want to thank them very much what they are doing what their participation in this panel that i want to thank all of you for coming out for helping us address one of the major crises facing thisthe and welcome everyone great to now a yeah i im happier than ever karen clark and live a few blocks from there is also welcome to my just didnt i win night

which is calling for a political revolution theyre just like the now little water and this is what i mean from the bottom of my heart and also with everything that i believe them intellectually i heard the jams burning burning burning and i appreciate that but this is not about burning it really is about you and when i just bought a lot of political revolution what everybody has got on the slant is not the only other classes and their representatives in washington on socalled that the best president in the world cannot the level all we need a mass movement of millions of people with the the movement at all anymore stands all it says loudly and clearly you that this great nation on the house and our government belonged to albany bowl and not just a head cold affiliate the this country

nobody will stop on the let me just very briefly very briefly give you an overview of some of the issues there we are gonna be campaigning on to my mind im the most significant issue we face is the worlds best level often commonweal getting quality in america the in america today um we have more in calm and wealth inequality than any other major industrialized country on earth and it is worse today that any time since nineteen the know i know years to overwhelm and income inequality is the great moral youre still up on him it is a great economic gives you all the time it is a great political if you all out of time and we are gonna do got into the and my only aim be very clear about this let me tell this to the billionaire lol class that today has it all there is something profoundly wall when the hardwon yeah all along per se not percent want to help one percent also also supports well as a lot of ninety percent they are resolving roles loudly wall when not even be not lying were said although income generated twoday goal at the heart one of his own there is something profoundly wall when in recent years we have seen a proliferation up millionaires and billionaires while the average american is working water well as below last years and we have the highest rate of childhood bloody largo de majo country on earth there is something profoundly ruled wind warning family in this country almost as much as well as a lot on all million americans this worldclass level updating them all and wealth inequality is bad economics it is unsustainable and this is what my upbringing economy which america is not so but also totally hot ill this is not the james the edward what youll look at all it is gonna change because we are going to create an account a million that works for all bball and not just a handful of people on the tom the but it is not just incall and wealth inequality is more than that today in america local what we are seeing is that all will last quality you years last years great middleclass of this country once the head be up to you by a world has been disappearing the today despite expanded my knowledge an explosion uh technology and huge increase in worker productivity median family income is almost five thousand dollars less that it was in ninety in my state overload and im short minutes old we have many more working not just one job to job three jobs trying to cobble together in a column and some pellicano that is not what this economy its almost like they allow the gruza the automobile im in in america is not quite like four or so its not the officials that is like dont you see we got to go the paywall if you include those people who have given up looking for work and all those people working parttime real unemployment in america today is close to presided you got unemployment is seventy percent africanamerican you love like that is all good thoughts today jangling we have applauded by billion people who are living in poverty and many of them all working forty or fifty hours alway today today we all live it in a day should which has more well then any shouldnt in the history uh the world but the problem here that all will all that well is going to go ahead well up people home dots room is that in the last years a there has been a eulogy redistribution well a it as a dog with a little class done a very rich and what we are saying today is it not only is the no we want not well the cod black the working families of the now let me know much alone may not fully healed that is a huge consequences for our country and let me be as blunt as i can tell you one as i can be in the holy name you like many of you already know and that is as a result of the disastrous supreme court decision on citizens united the american political says the has been slowly corrupted and the well you should pull american democracy got the what the supreme court house actually set to the wealthiest people in this country the billionaire class what is it is are you guys already own mucho you gonna be now were going to give you the opportunity to all the united states government and state governments all this country im and that is precisely what these people on now trying to do american democracy is not allow home billionaires being able to live candidates and elections it is not about the koch brothers sheldon adelson and other incredibly wealthy individuals spending billions and billions of dollars to elect candidates who will make the rich richer and everybody else moral there was recently a media report which is just that the whole world is themselves one of them second wealthiest american family name will spend more money in this election cycle then i will the democratic party all the republican party brothers and sisters that is not a democracy not cool paula coughlin the and when we talk about the major issues facing our country and in fact facing the world im when we talk about our responsibility uses human beings and as it turns a lot got want kids and seven grandchildren there is nothing more important then leaving this country end this planet in a way that is inhabitable for our kids and all branches of the go home told me is all the scientific community is virtually unanimous climate change israel climate change is caused by human activity climate change is already causing devastating problems in our country and around the world and if we do not get our act together in years the car the situation will be substantially world what the scientists are telling us if we allow businesses to go on as usual by the end of this century the planet /url could be buying to defend it really is paradigm wall of more riled more floods more extreme weather disturbances more rising sea levels mauled minnesota became shouldnt more diamond more disease more human suffering we meeting must not allow got to happen the hacksaw mold all the big oil companies in the koch brothers a make a lot of money and possible you all day one on not to address this issue but we all understand that is caretakers all our environment as many people who enjoy a little union all our country and the planet we are not going to allow them do the following this blood but their short term profits the know what are the challenges that we face that it is a huge time you know im is that the american people want very disillusioned with the political muscles they are very demoralized in the last midterm elections sixtythree percent well people didnt bowl he resigned young people the lovable and all over this country people are hurting theyre worried about their kids theyre worried about their parents so worried about what happens to the win the gold and we look to washington and leasing be those people theyre not dealing with the realities my like and they listen to the media on the television logo lol political gossip are all kinds the ground and not talking about the realities facing ordinary americans media looking at politics is a war a baseball game was so lopsided home rather than addressing the issues as to how we transform america what we need to do in my view you know the with your home and we have a website which is going to get better in bed at school bernie sanders like um we want your ideas we want your feedback is well go together but a sexually what we need to do use creative in the region very clear jenn that makes sense to working families all over this country as to what im the government should be doing to transform our country and improve lives rolling what i wanted to know in a few minutes you would you really luv pretty quickly young i want to watch along well i think could be innocent who will all be progressive agenda on and the person who now wield is when you want to be when you want to be with you do polls what people always say when you ask them what is the most important thing on their minds it so you cool little whirlwind gold jobs jobs and the reason they say that is the no that unemployment is much too long they worry about the kids being able to get a decent job they worry that the usability theyre gonna be delayed a long time and not be able to get a job that pays them in half the wages theyre currently burning so in my view we need the media room federal jobs program degrees millions apiece and then jobs the now and and a holeinone our infrastructure is crumbling l rules out which is all water systems always what our plans are at once i will ill let you use and what they mean enormous amount to were a little we ought not to invest happily and in wheeling this infrastructural and when we do let we make this country moral should what would dilute and save money and we can create with the trillion dollar investment which i have a proposal up to million these many jones the to little here is not only a marginal creating jobs which we have to do it is a question of saving and preserving jobs you are looking at a united states i dont know who was voted against trade agreements like nafta the i voted against nafta you have to remember the normal trade relations with china im and im gonna help lead his opposition against the transpacific partnership the it smoothens that since in vermont in minnesota ran all over this country we have lost almost six the thousand back two reasons and millions on these and many jobs we all who rawlins trade agreements that every corporation in america and the drug companies and will bring wide open and when their goal is the greatest situation with a good shot done in america and well do lowwage countries an hour job is done lol that we want trade agreements the wholesale for american workers and workers on the board that we want them to start creating jobs in america auto not just good other countries around the world the and when we leave more lol the economy when we talk about the economy lets all hope in clio that millions of american workers all working good wages on whats not much much bloom lolol the welcome our earnings middle mobile federal minimum wage uh seven dollars and twenty five insights into how well is a starvation wage weve got a razor what a living wage the as some of you may know the city of los angeles is a recently raise the minimum wage there are bucks an hour over her in a few years but not

got to change ste and well talk with whom respect and the working people of this country in olin every worker in america auto has been a bit sick leave bank guarantee but he should buy the now when we deal with an incall in wealth inequality what we have to understand that is not just another wellused people in this country and the largest corporations are doing phenomenally well what we also have

different lujan beloit this country do any yeah the we have see trillions of dollars all will last thirty years transit route for working families and the middle class upward and that is the premises on who would you will begin theres discussion im can we afford as a nation the reply free tuition ecologist because we cant can we have a higher quality excellent trial has this little which is a little to working families uh because weekend can we join the rest of the industrialized world and other national health care program guaranteed health care to all about the mobile uploads weekend the you only need to have the highest grade on trial the bloody have any major country on earth no wed all the do we need to have a he economic situated should when ninetynine percent in the cup goes to the top one percent dole well look so what if my holes is too old for schools really bernie sanders cant do it alone we have got do we would get along well do a school on grassroots movement the and stuck to the wall we have cock lincoln the non small we have dogs who in our own minds and our own hearts imagine in asian in a government which works cool all lost not a government dominated by a handful of billionaires and campaign contributors and wellbaby lobbyists we hand create any bad america ill because when we stand together on theyre all a heckuva lot more of a lost then call lets go home carpool during the me wellfighting for womens rights what youre doing to expand and improve our democracy one of the reasons and let me be very blunt the baptists one of the reasons im running for president of the united states is that i worry very much that both economically and politically our country is sliding into our daughter this is not an issue but theyre gonna see discuss much on tv but it is the reality of whats happening in america we all know wealthiest country in the history of the world but as we speak here and media this morning millions and millions of families are struggling to feed their kids we have the highest rate shamefully of poverty of any major country on earth and forty percent of africanamerican kids are living in poverty all at the same time percent of all new income is going to the top one percent and the top one tenth of one percent bonds almost as much well as the bottom and as a nation we are gonna have to ask ourselves whether it is morally acceptable whether it is economically sustainable thats all few have so much while so many have so little in my view has got to change and we need an economy that works for working families economics it is politics as a result of the disastrous citizens united supreme court decision millionaires and billionaires are pouring unlimited sums of money in true the political process through super pacs and independent expenditures in the last election last november sixtythree percent of the american people didnt vote eighty percent of young people didnt vote and in today millionaires and billionaires are buying the election is that what democracy in this country is supposed to be about i think not now the truth is all of you know republicans win when voter turnout is low when millions of people turn their backs on the political process when they look to washington and they sound working longer hours for low wages what are you doing for me when this i dont have any health insurance what are you doing for me when i say i cant afford to send my little baby into decent quality child care what are you doing some kind of water so my older kids to college what do you do it for me and when people give up on the political process and dog vote in large numbers when republican governors suppress the boat when the coprocessor the billionaires trying to buy elections republicans win and we look so what do we do what we do is make it clear that in this country we need a political revolution shin the same old same old way to do it their establishment economics is going to do it you want ill tell you how you win an election for the white house on you rally millions of workingclass people were given up on the political process young people political process you bring people together who are prepared to say loudly and clearly i love document belongs to all of us not just a handful of billion and if we do not do that and if this is a same old same old type of election and if millions of working people young people do not participate republicans will win and we will lose so let me tell you i am extremely gratified in my campaign so far that we have rallied hundreds of thousands of people to come out our meetings and events that we have seven hundred and fifty thousand individuals who have made campaign contributions not million dollar contributions to super pacs but apiece warning that any campaign at this point in a campaign in american history we win when people come together when we reject the division of men vs women are straight forces gay a black versus white are people born in this country as opposed to people born in another country that is what they wanted to go when we stand together and we say you know what in the wealthiest country in the history of the world the wealthy years people and the largest corporations are going to stop paying their fair share of taxes we win elections when we say to the working people in this country we know you cant make it on eight or nine bucks and hour and that is why were going to raise the minimum wage to an hour were going to win the election when we say two women there is no rational economic reason that women make cents on the dollar compared to then were gonna pay equity we win an election in which we say to working families yes when youre going to work you are going to have quality child care and prek your little ones where you win this election when we say to the unemployed were gonna rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of decent paying jobs and all people that we wonder what world the republicans are live again when they did not use science and refused to go forward in helping us combat climate change we win this election when we make it clear that women have fought long and too hot to lose control over their own bodies we win this election when we stand up boldly and say no youre not gonna or defund planned parenthood you gotta put more money so sisters and brothers we are at historical moment in american history the crises that we face today in many ways are worse than any time since the great depression of the nineteen thirties and in my view the what this election is about is not just selecting a president paul fall more significantly it is about transforming the united states of america it is about understanding that there is something very very wrong where the united states of america is the only major country on earth not guarantee theyd family and medical leave how does that happen country on earth does not guarantee paid sick time or paid vacation time how does that happen the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to every man woman and child as a right is to bringing people together by the tens of millions not stop and its tough to do but if we do that when i just gonna win this election we are going to win it by a landslide because what happens is how many people in your communities believe as republicans do that we should cut social security medicare cut medicaid cut federal aid to education and then give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top two twotenths of one percent nobody believes that but republicans can win elections because so many people have given up on the political process and what this campaign is about is revitalizing american democracy by bringing people together to stand up and fight for the promise of what this great country and be a nation in which the middle class grows not shrinks we can be a nation in which we do not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and what economic and wealth disparity we can do that but in order to do that were going to have to do something that is pretty hard pretty pretty pretty hard this is what we have to do in the last many decades everybody in this room knows because you have been part of the process we have made significant progress in becoming a less discriminatory society and we should be proud that we should be proud then in the american people decided to vote for a candidate based on his program and his ideas and his character not the color of his skin all over this country as a result of your efforts and those that came before you women have made extraordinary progress in breaking down discriminatory or discriminatory barriers and by the way we are not going back were gonna go close and if we were here ten years ago and somebody jumped up and said you know i think the gay marriage will be made legal in every state in this country somebody else would have asked them what they were smoking which raises another reason we have we have made progress weve made progress in womens rights in gay rights in civil rights we still have a long way to go in all of those areas but we should be proud of what we have accomplished but here is where we have not made progress we have not made progress in the economic struggle we have lost ground today men and women in many cases are working longer hours will lower wages of the new wealth and income is going to the people on top so the essential question in terms of economic struggle is all we prepared to organize and to take on the billionaire class which today has so much economic and political power that is the person and if we are not successful in doing that by prediction to you is that the rich will continue to get richer while most everybody else gets my prediction to you is that the republicans who do not believe citizens united went far enough want to get rid of all campaign finance regulations will simply be able through the koch brothers and others to give checks of hundreds of millions of dollars to the candidates of their choice in other words having candidates become employees of their corporate interests thats the future if we do not educate and if we do not organized but i have confidence that we can do but i have confidence that we have we come forward with a progressive strong agenda that he is prepared to stand up to corporate america is prepared to stand up to the koch brothers and the billionaire class that is prepared to outline an agenda which will improve the lives of tens of millions of our people we can not only win the white house regain the senate and the house gain governors trails all over america not only can we do that but much more importantly we cant transfer law in this country and make it the country we all know that it can become thank you all very muchby fall the higher prices in the world for prescription drugs now losing their jobs school roads bridges water has a total disaster but we can create thirty million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure to succeed we need to be educated schoolbrothers and sisters! my name is john nichols and i stand before you as a proud wisconsin progressive i am here in the tradition of robert m lafollette the capital times newspaper the progressive magazine the wisconsin idea and the wisconsin uprising of i am here to welcome you and i am here to welcome one of you because bernie sanders is not separate from the people in this room im not here to make any endorsements or deliver any grand statements about what you should do in thats not thats not what the wisconsin progressive movement was ever about the wisconsin progressive movement was about citizens gathering in church halls and schools and union halls and deciding the issues that mattered for them! this has always been a peoples movement and when leaders arrive the come from the people they dont dictate to the people im serious when i say im not here to tell you what to do you dont need someone to come up and tell you what to do you dont need someone to come up and tell you what to think about the presidential race senator bernie sanders will be here in a moment to make his case this campaign is all over this room theyve given you all sorts of information they want you to go to berniesanderscom they want you to text pull your phone out and do all that and type in bernie and you get updates all the time theyll tell you all the bells and whistles im not here to do any of that i am here to tell you what you have already done because what you have already done is more important than any thing that any candidate will do what you have already done is demand that the presidential race have a progressive voice at the table and you you demanded that it be someone who came from you someone who you knew you demanded that it be someone who has marched with you someone who has rallied with you someone who knows ed garvey and who has campaigned with ed garvey ladies and gentlemen the man who rebuilt the progressive movement in this state the father of fighting bob fess ed garvey right here up front right in front of him to rows up the mayor of madison paul soglin right here with us tonight couple steps away from him state senator fred risser the longestserving legislator in the united states state representatives terese berceau and and melissa sargent and a dozen others i cant even pick out here its a remarkable thing thats going on and i want you to know that a year ago when bernie sanders said to me that he was thinking of running for president of the united states i had my doubts but but then but then bernie sanders said you know wha cause he was pretty sure it was going to work because he said he wasnt going to do it like other people did it he was going to do it as a movement bernie sanders didnt make anything bernie sanders is the product of movements that have made everything people demanded a candidate who would stand up absolutely and apologetically for organized labor people demanded a candidate who would stand up absolutely and apologetically for fair trade not the broken free trade model of nafta and the tpp people demanded a candidate who would vote against wars and against the patriot act people demanded a candidate people demanded a candidate who would march with naomi klein and bill mckibben to say climate change is the essential issue of our time and people demanded demanded that finally a hundred years on we would get another candidate who would say as boldly as robert m lafollette did that this fight is not about parties and partisanship and ideology this fight is about all of us against a handful of plutocrats that would take everything we have brothers and sisters! wisconsin progressives you demanded a candidate who spoke your language and ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters please welcome senator bernie sanders! whoa! in case you havent noticed there are a lot of people here well let me let me begin by thanking john for that very generous introduction we love you bernie! and let me thank my dear friends ed and betty garvey for all the work theyve done for wisconsin and this country for so many years but mostly on this early summer night let me thank all of you for being here this evening now tonight tonight we have made a little bit of history you may know that there are some candidates running for president of the united states but tonight we have more people at a meeting for a candidate for president of the united states that any other has had in thank you! bernie! bernie! now it is now i was show something yesterday apparently the wisconsin republican party has welcomed me into the state with a billboard and the billboard indicated that i was an extremist so let me just say a few words to my friends in the republican party about extremism when you deny the right of workers to come together in collective bargaining thats extremism! when you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body thats extremism! when you think a woman is a child and cant purchase a contraceptive that is extremism! when you give tax breaks to billionaires and refuse to raise the minimum wage thats extremism but our views which represent in fact the vast majority of the american people are a little bit different we believe that the time has come when people in wisconsin vermont and all over this country create a political movement which say to the billionaire class you cant have it all! and what we are saying to the koch brothers governor walker and all those people is that this great country and our government belong to all of the people and not just a handful of very wealthy people now the truth of the matters is is that politics in a democratic society should not be complicated what politics should simply be about is people coming together taking a hard look at the problems that we face listen to different ideas and then go about solving those problems despite what the media may think politics is not a baseball game with polls politics is not a soap opera what politics is about in a democratic society is people coming together and improving life for our people and today i want to touch on some of the major issues that are facing our people and talk to you about some ideas as to how we can address those problems but the first point i want to make and john nichols has already made it and let me be very clear about this this campaign is not about bernie sanders it is not about hillary clinton it is not about anybody else it is about putting together a grassroots movement of millions and millions of people who stand together and make it clear that we need fundamental changes in the economics and politics of this country so the government works for all of us and not a handful of wealthy campaign contributors and let me also tell you that in order to win this election it goes without saying that we need a strong grassroots movement an unprecedented grassroots movement but let me say this to you also and this is something that no other candidate will tell you and that is that nobody in the white house no matter how good he or she may be can address the major issues facing the working families and the middle class without an act of politically conscious grassroots movement and the reason for that the reason for that is not complicated it is that the big money interests wall street corporate america all of these guys have so much power that no president can defeat them unless there is an organized grassroots movement making them an offer they cant refuse and that is what this campaign is about what this campaign is about is creating a political revolution in america a revolution which takes on the greed of wall street and corporate america a revolution which takes on the reality that the republican party is essentially owned by big money interests and too many democrats are owned by big money interests today we live hard to believe many people dont sense it we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world thats where we are today but most people in this country dont sense that dont feel that because all of the wealth is being held in the hands of a very few america today has more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth and the gap between the very very rich and everyone else is wider in america today than it has been since the issue of wealth and income inequality to my mind is the great moral issue of our time it is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time let me be as clear as i can be there is something profoundly wrong when today the top onetenth of one percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom there is something profoundly wrong when today of all new income is going to the top there is something profoundly wrong when in recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same exact time as millions of americans are working longer hours for lower wages and we have by far the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major industrialized country there is something profoundly wrong when one family the walton family of walmart owns more wealth than the bottom million americans this grotesque level of inequality is immoral it is bad economics it is unsustainable and it is not what the united states of america is supposed to be about this is a rigged economy and brothers and sisters together we are going to change that this campaign is sending a message loud and clear to the billionaire class and that is you cant get tax breaks when children in america go hungry you cannot continue to send our jobs to china when millions of americans are desperately looking for work you cant hide your profits in cayman islands and in other tax havens while we have so many unmet needs in america youre gonna have to start paying the greed the greed of corporate america and the billionaire class has got to end and we are gonna end it for them but the issue of our economy is not just income and wealth inequality the issue of whats going on in our economy deals with the tragic reality that for the last years years the great middle class of america once the envy of the entire world has been disappearing despite exploding technology so that every worker is significantly more productive then those who came before median family income is almost less today than it was in in my state of vermont and i am sure that it is true here in wisconsin we have workers not working at job not working at jobs but sometimes at or jobs at abysmally low wages in order to cobble together an income and some health care that is not the american economy that we will accept and when you look at the economy what you have to understand is that every month the government announces a statistic about official unemployment currently it is about but if you look at another government statistic which includes those people who have given up looking for work and those people those millions of people who are working parttime when they want to work fulltime real unemployment today is close to that is unacceptable and let me touch on an issue that is widely ignored almost nobody talks about it and that while real unemployment is close to youth unemployment has reached tragic proportions today in america for those young people to those kids who have graduated high school or have dropped out of high school if they are white youth unemployment is if they are hispanic youth unemployment is if they are africanamerican youth unemployment is in my view maybe just maybe it makes sense to create jobs and educational opportunities for these young people maybe we should create jobs and educational opportunities for the people rather than more and more incarceration and more and more jails today in america today in america shamefully we have more people in jail than any other country on earth so our job in fact is to create a new criminal justice system our job is police department reform our job is to make sure the young africanamericans can walk down the street without being abused or worse our job our job is to have the besteducated population in the world not the country with the most people in jail and when we talk about the economy its not only the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality its not only the unacceptably high levels of unemployment when we talk the economy today we have to understand that tens of millions of americans are working in wages which are totally inadequate and i know that governor walker may disagree but to my mind the federal minimum wage of an hour is a starvation wage which must be raised the minimum wage must become a living wage which means an hour over the next few years now i dont think it is a terribly radical idea to say that in america if someone works hours a week that that person should not be living in poverty and brothers and sisters a living wage should not only be fair it should be equitable there is no excuse for women making cents on the dollar compared to men and let me congratulate president obama for doing something that is long overdue and making sure that millions of working people finally get time and a half when theyre working or hours a week thats an issue that many of us have been working on and im glad the president came through now as some of you may know many of our republican friends are very deeply concerned about family values they just they love families and their view of family values is that women should not be able to control their own bodies their view of family values is that women should not be able to purchase the contraceptives they need you know when i say these things it really is hard to believe can you imagine and their view of family values is that gay people should not be able to get married now that is their view their warped view of family values let me give you another view of family values i have kids i got beautiful grandchildren my wife is hear weve been married for years i believe and you believe in the importance of family and that is why because we believe in real family values the united states must end the international embarrassment of being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave that does not guarantee workers paid sick time or paid vacation time so let me talk a little bit about family values today in wisconsin or in vermont a woman is having a baby one of the most meaningful and important moments in her life father standing right beside her but because that family does not have a lot of money that woman will forced to go back to work in a week of or days that is not a family value in every other major country women regardless of their incomes and the father as well are able to stay home with their baby get to know their baby in the most important moments of their babys life that is a family value and that is why i will fight for weeks of paid family and medical leave let me touch on another issue that is almost never talked about at all but it is an issue of enormous consequence and that is as the result of the collapse of the american middle class what we are seeing is people in our country working incredibly long hours incredibly long i go around the country and i look in the eyes of people they are tired theyre exhausted theyre stressed out because they are working and working and working ill tell you a brief story couple of years ago outside a grocery store in burlington vermont i met a woman and she came up to me she said you know bernie my husband and i have one kid but we would like to have more kids but im working jobs hes working jobs and we do not believe that we can be the parents we should be so were putting off having more kids that story is being told all over america today the american people are working longer hours than the people of any other major country on earth the japanese are very hardworking people we work hours a year more than the japanese we work more hours a year than the british and we work almost hours a year more than our good friends in france what can we say about the french now heres the point and i want i say this in order to put where we are today in a broader context when we were kids in school and we read history textbooks we saw pictures in those books of workers out on the streets demonstrating years ago those workers held up these big banners and the signs and you know what those signs said they said we want a hour work week! what they said is what they said is we are not beasts of burden we want time with our families we want time for education we need time for leisure that was years ago today unbelievably of working men and of working women work more than hours a week years have come and gone and we have lost ground now at the very least what the united states must do and i will do as president is to make sure that every family in this country gets at least weeks off of paid vacation now when pollsters go out and they ask american people what is uppermost on their mind what are they most worried about the answer always is a fourletter word called jobs jobs when you have real unemployment of youth unemployment over now is the time for a federal jobs program to create millions of decentpaying jobs in virtually every state in this country our infrastructure our roads our bridges water systems waste water plants our rail system our levies and out dams need an enormous amount of work now is the time to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure a one tril a one trilliondollar investment will create and maintain some million jobs and that is exactly what i intend to do but when we talk about jobs its not just the need to create millions of decentpaying jobs it is the necessity to end job loss as a result of disastrous trade policies you are looking at a senator and former congressman who voted against nafta against cafta against permanent normal trade relations and i will do everything that i can to defeat this disastrous tpp and when we talk about rebuilding the american middle class were talking about rebuilding the american trade union movement there are millions of workers who would like to join unions today but are unable to do so because of illegal actions on the part of their employers in my view if + of workers in a bargaining unit sign a card asking for a union they should have that union and when we talk about greed when we talk about recklessness when we talk about illegal behavior these are just another word another phrase to describe wall street in my view and this a hugely important issue for the future of our economy it is time to break up the largest financial institutions in this country wall street continue to be an island unto itself gambling trillions in risky financial instruments while expecting the public to bail it out in my view and weve introduced legislation to deal with this if a bank is too big to fail it is too big to exist when we talk about issue of jobs or education or the environment or any other significant issue they all are related to another issue which undermines everything else thats going on in america and i think you in wisconsin are very familiar with this issue so let me be as blunt as i can be when i tell you what you already know and that is that as a result of the disastrous supreme court decision in the citizens united case the american political system has been totally corrupted and the foundations of american democracy are being undermined what the supreme court said in so many words is they said to the wealthiest people in this country they said ok guys you already own much of the economy now we are going to give you the opportunity to own the united states government and that is what they are trying to do right now let me be as clear as i can be and that is that as president of the united states i will not nominate any justice to the supreme court who has not made it crystalclear that he or she will vote and work to overturn this disastrous citizens united decision longterm overturning citizens united is terribly important passing a disclosure law is terribly important but longterm if we want to see a vibrant democracy where people of any political point of view who want to be in public service can get up and run for office without having to beg rich people for money we need to move to public funding of elections let me give you an example give you an example of how bad the situation is today according to media reports which i think are accurate the koch brothers alone secondwealthiest family in america a family that wants to eliminate social security medicare medicaid public education and virtually every piece of legislation passed since the s which protect the working families this one family will be spending in this election cycle close to and theyre job and what theyre money is about is to elect candidate who make the rich richer and everybody else poorer but when you have family spending close to a billion dollars which is more money than either the democratic party or the republican party will spend this is not democracy this is oligarchy and we have got to end it and let me also be clear that american democracy means one person one vote american democracy means that we try to have the highest voter turnout in the world american democracy does not mean voter suppression or the gerrymandering of districts i think everybody here knows that we are living in a very competitive global economy and that if we are gonna succeed if our economy is going to do well in years to come we need to have the besteducated workforce in the world to my mind it is basically insane and i use that word advisably and counterproductive to the future of this country when we have today hundreds of thousands of bright young qualified people who want to get a higher education they want to go to college but they are locked out because their families dont have enough money and that is not only pulling the ladder out from under these young people who want to work hard and make it to the middle class it is not the way you create a growing and vibrant economy when we need doctors and scientists and nurses and teachers and all kinds of educated workers but the issue goes beyond the high cost of college and people not being able to get in to college today we have a situation where we have millions of young and notsoyoung people who are shouldering horrendous college debt decade after decade a year or so ago i met with some folks and there was a young women there whose dream it had been to go to medical school and practice primary care for lowerincome people exactly the kind of physicians that we need and thats what she did and as a result she left school in debt for the crime of going to medical school so she can work with lowincome people then i thought that that was really quite extreme and then i was in iowa a couple of months ago and i mention this fact and a young woman came up to me after my remarks and she said senator i just graduated dental school in debt now that is why and all over this country young people fifty sixty thousand dollars in debt talk to somebody recently spending of her income paying back student debt people cant get married they cant get have kids cant buy a house because of the student debt so weve introduced legislation which i will push through as president that does two things number one it will make every public college and university in america tuitionfree and i want you to know the importance of that concept is not just for kids in the th or th grade who want to go to college the importance of that concept is that it will resonate with kids in the th grade and in the th grade right now all over america there are young kids who may not know it intellectually but they know it emotionally their parents didnt go to college the kids in their neighborhood dont go to college why should they study hard why should they do their homework if theyre not going be able to get a higher education or get into the middle class thats wrong! so we are saying to every kid in america if you study hard if you do your work you will in fact be able to get all the education you need regardless of the income of your family and when we talk about student debt it is absolutely unconscionable that we have folks today who are paying interests rate of on student debt which they are stuck with for decades yet they can go out and refinance their home for or so what weve got to do is allow people with student debt to refinance weve got to get the government out of the business of profiteering off of student debt as well and when we do that we can cut student interest rates by more than half now when we talk when we talk about the major issues facing not only our country but the world it is absolutely essential that we talk about our responsibilities as human beings as adults as parents and understand that there is nothing more important than leaving this planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and our grandchildren the debate is over the scientific community has spoken in a virtually unanimous voice climate change is real climate change is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems all over our country and all over the world you dont have to look further than the water situation in california you dont have to look further than whats going on in pakistan where people are dying from an unprecedented heat wave the scientists are telling us loudly and clearly that if we do not boldly transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy this planet will see a temperature rise of between and degrees centigrade with extraordinary negative consequences what that means is more drought more floods more extreme weather disturbances more acidification of the ocean more rising sea levels and what the cia and the department of defense tell us is that when people around the world dont have food because the land that they are working on is no longer arable when they do not have enough water this causes international security issues where people fight each other for limited natural resources as a nation we can as a nation we must lead the entire world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and let me just let me just mention something to you that many of you know know and that is today sadly tragically the united states of america is the only major industrialized nation that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right that is not something that we should be proud of it is something we should be embarrassed about despite the gains of the affordable care act million americans continue to lack health insurance and many more are underinsured with high deductibles and high copayments yet despite all of that we continue to spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other nation in my view this country must make two fundamental decisions with regard to health care number one in america health care must be a right for all of our people and number two if we are going to provide health care to all of our people in a costeffective way if were going to take the burden off the backs of small businesses we need to move to a medicare for all singlepayer system all of you who are here this evening i think have an understanding about how real change takes place in our country and has historically taken place you are aware that change takes place from the bottom on up its never from the top on down people on top are usually the last to know you are all aware that a hundred and more years ago workers who were working incredibly long hours under horrendous working conditions said enough is enough were going to form unions and engage in collective bargaining and as a result of those efforts we have created a middle class in this country workers had decent wages decent benefits and politically because of millions of workers coming together we passed social security medicare and medicaid and many other programs to help the american people because people came together all of you are aware of the tragic history of racism in america but for a very long time africanamericans and their white allies came together and they struggled and they stood up for justice and they stood up to lynching and they stood up to segregation and they stood up to a situation that africanamericans couldnt even vote in america and change came about not as much as we would want we know that we still have racism in america but as a nation we should be proud of the fact that in we elected the first africanamerican to be the president of the united states most of all things so many people stood up for civil rights didnt happen because of a few and when we talk about womens rights we know that women the suffragettes susan b anthony and all those folks went to jail some of the died and they said women in america and around the world will not be secondclass citizens! and that struggle continues to exist today and then in more recent history we have seen gay people saying we will not be discriminated against any more and a huge change swept the country huge change in consciousness and said that we are going to treat all of our people with respect and dignity no matter what their sexual orientation may be and last week a very conservative supreme court finally made gay marriage legal in states so as a nation we have a right to be very proud of the successes that we have seen because of the struggles of millions of people to create a less discriminatory society thats something we should be proud of right we deserve a hand for that but there is one struggle in which not only have we not succeeded but in which we are losing ground and that is the fundamental struggle for economic justice i am in the senate the ranking member of the budget committee which means that i am the democratic leader on that committee and i want to give you an example and i want to speak now not just to the people in this room but to working class and middle class republicans in the state of wisconsin because i want you to know what many people do not know i want you know what your party the republican party is doing in washington dc this is what the republican budget did and i know something about it because i am the ranking member of this committee this is what it did months ago this legislation was passed and this legislation sets the framework for what the appropriations committees will do later on million americans have no health insurance only country major country on earth without health care for all republicans decided to end the affordable care act cut medicaid by over billion dollars throw million americans off of health insurance at a time when the middle class is struggling to send their kids to college republican budget over a year period cut billion dollars from the pell grant program at a time when millions of americans are working or hours a week and are not earning the income they need to adequately feed their family the republicans made massive cuts in nutrition programs for hungry people and for children including the wick program which is designed to protect lowincome pregnant women and their newborn babies and then after making massive cuts in health care education nutrition and many many other programs that working families depend upon the republicans decided to give over billion dollars of tax breaks to the top twotenths of in my view in my view when we reach out and what this campaign is about is to reach out to working families all over this country including republicans because i believe i believe i believe that the koch brothers and the republican leadership in washington has gotten away with murder for too many years what they have done is try to divide our country up black vs white native vs immigrant gay vs straight and what they have done is try to divide us our job is to bring people together around a progressive agenda that works for all of us go out please where we need where we need most help not just in winning this election but in transforming america is to create a process by which people stop voting against their own best interest ask your republican friends at work if they really think it makes sense to vote for people who are going to send their jobs abroad vote for people who will not raise the minimum wage vote for people who will take health care away from their own children and when we are successful in bringing our people the middle class working people together we will transform america let me conclude by saying this if anything what i would like to ask of you is think big not small in washington the debate is often about whether we cut education by or whether we throw this many people or that many whether we give corporations this much of a tax break or that much of a tax break thats not the world view we should have our vision should be that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world there is nothing that we cannot accomplish we can! we can provide health care to every man woman and child as a right we can make certain that every person in this country can get all of the education he or she needs regardless of the income we can create millions of decentpaying jobs we can have the best childcare system in the world in the last years there has been a huge redistribution of wealth from the middle class and the working families to the top our job is to reverse that redistribute wealth back into the hands of working families now in terms of this campaign i am more than aware that my opponents will be able to outspend us they have billionaire backers they have super pacs theyve a lot of millionaire friends but we are gonna win this election be we are gonna win this election because if we do our job well if we develop the grassroots national movement that i know we can at the end of the day they may have the money but we have the people and when the people stand together we can win! thank you all very much!the thank you thank you the thank you you know we have heard we have had large turnouts in wisconsin in colorado this is the largest turnout the are the the there are a lot of people here you know when we were coming to arizona somebody said arizona is a conservator stay what they talkin somebody told me that people are given up on the political process not what i see a tonight the thank you all so much i cannot believe this crowd i just one of thank you so much the company of the presidents you are incredible practices here tonight gives me hope and gives people all over this country hope that when we stand together when we come together in meetings like this there is nothing that we cannot accomplish a transforming america the and i wanna thank you land of for that wonderful introduction shes a member of the cw a and i thank the cw way have a trade union movement this country what this campaign is about is pretty simple what this campaign is about is saying that our great country an hour government belong to all the people and not a handful billionaires the well i wont to do tonight is to do something that we to rally to and that is just lay on the table the important issues facing our country and determine how we can go forward so that government represents all of us and addresses the serious problems that we face and the first issue the first issue well i wont to put on the table is the issue of income and wealth inequality the today we live in eighty nation which has more income and more wealth any quality than any other major country on earth that is not acceptable its a gap of we are gonna change not the if you think about it for a moment you recognize that the issue loving commonwealth inequality is a moral issue all we could sense the perry did finish the sentence all week concerns to seeing a proliferation uh millionaires and billionaires what we have the highest rate of childhood poverty have any major country on earth it is a moral issue but it is an economic issue as well because our economy can not do well when so few have so much and so many have so little the my republican friends think that the ceos of large corporations on the job creators you know do you know who the job creators of you are the job creators the and when working people have money in their pocket they go out and they buy goods today by services and when they do that they create jobs but when millions of people have nothing to spend we are not creating the jobs that we need and that is why i believe that what our economics should be about is putting money it to the hands of working people and not the billionaires the brothers and sisters there is something profoundly wrong when the top one to ban of percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom ninety percent there is something profoundly wrong when in the last several years fiftyeight percent all new income created has gone to the top one percent there is something profoundly wrong when one family one family the owners a walmart own more well on the bottom percent up the american people this grotesque level of income and wealth any quality is bad economics it is unsustainable and it is not what the united states of america is supposed to be about the and we have a message tonight to the billionaire class and that message is you cannot how did all the you cannot cure huge tax breaks where children in vermont then arizona go hungry you cannot could continue to to ship our jobs to china when millions of americans need work here the you cannot hide your profits your billions in profits in the cayman islands and other tax havens when we have on matt needs that america that box be address the and what we are saying to the billionaire class is they agree has got tired and we are gonna dead followed up the what it is not charged the grotesque an embarrassing love com and wealth inequality when we talk about whats going on in america today we have gone to recognize the tragic reality that for the last yeah its not ten years not twenty book for the last forty years the great middleclass of this country once the envy of the entire world that middleclass has been disappearing and i want you to think about this all love you know now we have seen in recent years an explosion up technology and work of productivity and yet despite that median family income today is almost five thousand dollars lasts that it was in all over america all over america all over our great country people are working not just one job not just two jobs theyre working three jobs for jobs to cobble together some income and some health care this economy can do and much too better than that let me say a word about on employment once a month you read the official unemployment results coming from the government and they tell you that official unemployment is percent but what they dont tell you is if you look at another government statistic which includes those people have given of looking for work and those people who are working parttime you know everybody working parttime when i want to work full time when un although back together real unemployment is per side and let me tell you something apps that we all most noble the scars and that is the tragedy abused unemployment in this country a recent study came out recent study came out looking at kids who graduated high school and this is what it said if those kids were whites their real unemployment rate was thirty percent if they were hispanic their unemployment rate was thirty sixpercent if they were africanamerican their unemployment rate was per side and let me tell you something else in america today we have more people in jail than any other country on earth thats right and one of the reasons aside from a broken criminal justice system one of the reasons that we have so many people in jail is that we have five and a half million kids hanging out on street corners with no jobs and no education and it seems to me to make a lot more sense to invest in education and jobs for our kids rather go to jail credit card for richer the i wont our country to have the best educated people more people going to college than any other country not more people jail than any other country the and when we talk about the economy its not just income and wealth inequality its not just high unemployment is low low wages all over our country in my state in your state you got people work in hours a week not earning the money they need to feed their families or put a few books in the back in washington the federal minimum wage is seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour brothers and sisters is a starvation wage we have got to talk we have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage bucks an hour the i dont think it is a radical idea to say there is somebody works hours a week that person should not be living in poverty thats what america should be and when we talk about fair wages we also have to understand that it is unacceptable that women today make cents on the dollar compared to the brothers we have got to stand with our system is and fight for pay equity for women workers now is many of you know a lot of my republican colleagues you know what they stand for well let me tell you what they stand for summer what these what are republican colleagues talk about of family values are real talk about family values and this is what damian by family values they mean that a woman should not be able and have the right to control her own body i get some great day believe that women if you can believe this should not be able to purchase the contraceptives they wont and they believe that our gay brothers and sisters should not have the right to marry those aug now family values goes on not our family values but let me tell you well i think family values should be real family values that support families that enable love to exist can to exist in families first we have doctor ends the international embarrassment up the united states being the only major country on earth which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave today in arizona today in vermont a woman is giving birth if that woman has ample income she will be able to stay home and the father will be able to stay home with that baby to get to bond with their baby to get the love that baby to get to know that baby in perhaps one of the most important moments in a familys like but if that woman does not have adequate income she will be forced to go back to work in three days five days seven days is not a family value that is that is exactly the opposite a a family value was not as wide i will fight for and bring about weeks of paid family and medical the all over this country thats right all over this country we have working people thing when they get sick they go to work and they go to work because they have no guaranteed sick time its time to end not they provide guaranteed paid sick time for every worker in america you know i think we all heard a few weeks ago that jeb bush thinks that the american people jeb bush leagues the american people need to work a little bit hard worli obviously didnt heal the sad reality that the american people already work the longest hours uh any major country on earth our people do not need to work longer hours they need hi all wagers and better a job now when we talk about the crises facing our country when pollsters asked people whats on your mind what do you think is most important what people invariably say is jobs we need more jobs well in my view when we have over percent youth unemployment ten and a half percent unemployment in general when our infrastructure our roads bridges water systems rail are crumbling we can and should put millions of people back to work rebuilding how crumbling infrastructure hired introduce legislation that would put a trillion dollars into our roads and bridges which would create up to third see million jobs and that is exactly what we have to do think up in america where all over this country our people are rebuilding our slippers now far behind many other countries lets her out the best rail system in the world but what are people to work doing and when we talk about creating jobs we also have to talk about stopping the loss of jobs because about disastrous trade policies youre looking at a senator who voted against nafta again after the against permanent normal trade relations with china and is leading the opposition to this disastrous trade tpp trade again we need trade policies which create jobs in on america we did corporate america to start investing in america and not just countries all over the world now when we talk when we talk about whats going on in this country but we talk about greed when we talk about recklessness when we talk about illegal behavior these are john some other words that we use to describe wall street today lee largest financial institutions in this country have assets absorb trillion dollars acquittal in the sixty percent to the gdp of america after we bailed them out because they were too big to fail most to them uh now a lot bigger than they were before we bail them out in my view if a financial institution should is too big to fail it is too big cents and that is why i have introduced legislation to break these huge financial institutions up now wanna talk very briefly about an issue which in many ways maybe more important then any other and that is that is a result of the disastrous supreme court decision in the citizens united case the american political system has been totally corrupted and the foundations of american democracy lobbying undermines what the supreme court said to the wealthiest people in our country they said okay guys you already own much should the economy were now going to give you the opportunity to all alone the united states government and that is what they are trying to do in this campaign the koch brothers on low the snack wealthiest family in america will be spending almost a billion dollars in this campaign cycle that is more money then i for the democratic or republican partys on spending when one family spends more money than either of the two major political parties that is not democracy bodies i look cokie and that is why we have got to overturn citizens united and why do we need public funding other elections i wont i see a lot of young people here today the in our ward our young people to be able to run for office if they want to do and not have to big money for the rich and the powerful to dole out and now that we have a lot of young people here let me mention another issue a bit bored and so are you right now all love you know that we live as a nation in a highly competitive global economy and if we are going to succeed into the future we need the best educated workforce in the world at this moment if you can believe that this is how crazy it is there are hundreds of thousands albright hardworking qualified young people for unable to get a college education not because they dont have the ability but because their family does it how the money so th ramon but what it means the sum kid some lowincome kids a workingclass kid who wants to make it into the middle class but cant go to college because his family lacks the funds thats wrong and that is why i have introduced legislation and will fight for his president to make every public collagen university in america to your kid great the and i want you i want you to think for a moment i want you to think for a moment what free public college and three public university will mean what it will be what it will be is not only helping kids was seniors or juniors in high school what it will tell kids in the fourth grade in the sixth grade here in phoenix or burlington vermont that no matter how poor you may be if you study hard you do well in school you can in fact get all the education unique and the other higher education the other higher education issue that weve got to deal with is the absurdity uh millions of americans some young good some not so young for carrying out regis student debt i may not talkin not just on a hundred thousand i talk to young woman graduated dental school four hundred thousand dollars in debt what my legislation would do is and the absurdity up people with student debt paying eight nine ten percent interest rates the if you can refinance your home at two or three percent there shouldnt be paid percent by justin and we have also cox against the us government out of the business are profiteering whats new today the there is a nother issue that is up such great importance the pope francis in a recent and cyclical focus on it and by the way god bless pope francis cosigner the you know i think sometimes people think by economic views are radical you should do with this guy is so when he talks about money being god modern civilization people worshipping money rather than their brothers in their sisters but what he wrote about in his recent encyclical is what virtually the entire scientific community is telling us and that is that we have a moral obligation as adults and parents to leave this planet to our kids and grandchildren in a habitable way climate change israel climate change is caused by human activity climate change is already causing devastating problems in our country and all ovr the world we must leave the world in an extremely aggressive way in breaking our dependence on fossil fuels in movie in moving to win so long geothermal and other sustainable energies and heres what the scientists tell us they say if we do not do that by the end of this century this planet will be between five and ten degrees fahrenheit warm and what that will mean is more droughts more flooding more extreme weather disturbances more acidification of the ocean more more international conflict his countrys fight force castle not rule resources we have a moral obligation to leave the world in transforming our energy system and when we talk about rights and when we talk about how the united states and many respects lags behind other countries there is no issue in which side is clear all then the issue aug health care today the united states of america is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as the right together you and i are going to end died in paris vid because we are gonna pass a medicare for all singlepayer program we can do it we cant do it healthcare must be seen as a rights not a privilege what we have also got to do is we transform america is to understand a very simple point and im the only candidate for president who will tell you this but it is the truth and that is no president none no matter how good he or she may be can bring about the changes that we need desperately need in this country on last there is a political revolution and what that political revolution means is that people all over america have got to stand up and bcom involved in the political process in a way we have never done before we have got to also is part of that revolution have real debate on real issues which is what im trying to do tonight i want you to do me a favor i want you to talk go out to be a zone of comfort i want you to talk to your republican friends and family members now heres the boy heres a boy heres the boy it is one thing for the billionaire class to be voting republican but there are many republicans out there you know them these people are working to two or three jobs they have no health care their kids can afford to go to college and yet theyre voting against people who are fighting against their best address every single day ask your republican friends why they vote for folks who want to tax breaks for billionaires yet they want to cut social security and medicare passcode why theyre voting for people youre gonna throw out onto the street shut down their factories and move their plants abroad so what we need to do is to create a political movement a political movement which brings our people together what republicans what republicans are very good at is not talking about what they really belief you have never seen an airhead on tv would says vote for me so i could cut your social security i give a tax break two billionaires but that is exactly wat they aug trying to do now how do they get away with this stuff ill tell you how de tocqueville i dont stop by race by country of origin by sexual orientation by john doe they say they say no whites worry about blacks they say the nativeborn americans worry about immigrants they say the man worry about women our job is not to divide our job is to bring people together the and when we talk about bringing one day should together we have got to understand that today in america there are any lavigne million people living in the shadows people who are afraid that they could be deported to borrow that is wrong we need capri had served immigration roflol the we a path toward citizenship for undocumented people we need not to be dividing families waiting to be united families are keeping them together the now in our country there is a lock that we should be proud of we have made significant progress in recent years in breaking down many barriers up discrimination if we were sitting here or in your case standing here thirty years ago and somebody said you know i have a crazy idea i think that may be in the united states will have overcome its racist history an elected africanamerican to be president people would have said thats crazy that will happen it happen because we overcame unlock abrasives plotline auspey very clear while we have overcome a lot of racism we have come a long way we still have a wall on way to go it is not acceptable to me and i know to you that an africanamerican baby a male baby born today if we do not change things stands in four chance up being in prison during his life it is not acceptable to be that we have seen young black man walk down streets in this country be beaten and be killed on joycelyn that is not acceptable boasts police officers i was a male i was a mayor for eight years and i worked with the police what its a tough job both cops do it well but when a police office of breaks the law that office of must be held accountable why luxury let me conclude by saying this i want you all to think big knock think small i watch youtube all appreciate that you are living in the wealthiest country today in the history of the world the wealthiest country but nobody knows it because all all the wealth rest in the hands but a few so what we need to do is to have a vision where it says said well and income become spread out in a way then is fair what we need to do is to have a vision that says that every person in this country is it ill to health care as the right that when a mom or dad goes to work he or she knows let their kid in a trial care center where prek will get the best quality care available i am the former chairman of the senate veterans committee an ira well tell you that in this country we have a moral obligation to make sure that every veteran every man and woman to put their lives on the line to defend his country tax payer healthcare and the benefits they do we are not good at the fair when i go to turn our backs on our veterans we are going to be a nation and we are going to create a nation where everyone no matter their race their religion their disability or their sexual orientation realizes the full potential other quality that is the birthright americans i several years ago i attended a meeting in northern vermont which was honoring veterans who fought world war to end at the beginning of that meeting somebody played a tape video tape booking at franklin delano roosevelt on december and i was the day after pearl harbor and what roosevelt was doing that day was the clearing mortgage dependent so do declare war against hitler in germany on that day the united states was unprepared to fight one war let alone two wars but in two and a half years because this country focus by creating the best military in the world produce enough to banks are the planes and because we do we won that war in two and a half years so i dont want anybody to tell me that this country when we bought our minds to it cannot guarantee health care at all dog pound me we cant leave the world in combating climate change what have the best infrastructure in the world dog pound me dont tell me cuz i dont believe it there we can create a system where all of our kids get a great education but not if this comes easy frederick douglass the great abolitionist told us that freedom does not calm without struggle i need you because this is not about me its about costs we to stand together to make not political revolution where we create and america any government that works for all of us we can do it when we stand up we cant do it when we stand off and saturday are not is a knot the billionaire so im not gonna have it all its our country blacks create dad asian thank you all very much homeamerica thank you for putting on this important conference let me from the slot suggests i am not frank underwood talking about is wrenching the hearts of the american people consciousness on criminal justice reform has risen significantly in the last couple of years a lot of that has to do with this kind of invention here where for years a lot of crimes were being committed that were not being talked about but now when they get video would make it on television they are being talked about and that is a very very good thing and lose clearly time that we start talking as we have in this election about the really disastrous effects of too many politicians trying to too many elections by locking too many people remember were going to be tough on crime and throw away the key were gonna do this look into that all of that has resulted in an international disgrace that all of you know it at the united states of america today has more people in jail than any other country on earth including china which is authoritarianism communist country four times our thoughts and we as a people have to leave this issue right on the table and that is that people in american jails are disproportionately to a very significant degree people of color and that is the reality in america today and that is a reality that has to change too many lives to too many lives are being destroyed and together we are going to bring about major reforms of a broken criminal justice system with an issue that is on everyones mind and that is the continuing struggle for racial justice in american lets talk with the facts these are not pleasant facts but these are facts we have got to discuss if current trends continue approximately one in four black males born today a child born here in south carolina today can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime this is an unspeakable tragedy blacks are in prison and six times the rate of white people of color are incarcerated police and sentenced to death at significantly higher rates than their white counterparts one in every africanamerican men is incarcerated compared to one in every and six whiteman a report by the department of justice found that blacks were three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop compared to white motorists africanamericans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounter is with the police africanamericans make up two fifths of confined youth today africanamerican women are three times more likely than white women to be incarcerated once conducted black offenders received longer sentences percent longer than wide offenders for the same exam crimes thirteen percent of africanamerican men have lost the right to vote guilty to felony convictions and this by the way is an issue we dont talk about very much but it is a huge political consequence percent of africanamerican men have lost their right to vote these shocking statistics to say the least but before we even addressed them we have to deal with the most urgent and obvious issue that needs to be addressed headon and that is the killing of africanamericans by police or deaths while in custody of tragedies we hear about screams out for justice the black lawyers mountable which has arisen in response to these deaths has done a needed and commendable job in raising public consciousness on this issue the proliferation of cell phone video has brought the reality of these deaths into the living room and onto the computer screen of millions and millions of people throughout our country i know you have heard these names before but they bear repeating so we do not lose sight of the real human price being paid michael brown scott pretty great plan to me rice samuel duboce cuboid and many many of us but people must do more than just echo the phrase backlight was matta we must put actions behind those words will bring about a fundamental reform that is needed in the face of this crisis criminal justice reform must be the civil rights issue of the st century and the first piece that we must address is police before the killings of unarmed african americans has got to stop nation too many africanamericans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes as if they were criminals a growing number of communities do not trust the police and police have become disconnected alien to the communities that they are sworn to protect at the federal level we need to establish a new model police training program that reorient the way we do law enforcement in this country with input from a broad segments of the community we must reinvent how weak police america a critically important component of this reform is a set of new rules on the allowable use of force soul force must be the last resort not the first result need to be trained to deescalate confrontations and humanely interact with people who have mental illnesses someone and by the way this happened to my own state of vermont not a military woman called police because her mentally ill son was acting out soon got shot and killed that happens all across this country we also need police forces that reflect the diversity of our communities and i must extend into the leadership of police departments and into the training departments clearly we need greater civilian oversight of police departments and ongoing and meaningful community engagement we need to federally fund and require body covers law enforcement offices to make it easier to hold them accountable but we also must establish standards and processes to protect the privacy of innocent people our justice department must aggressively investigate and prosecute police officers who break the law and hold them accountable for their actions we may need to examine when current federal civil rights status provides the justice department to protect the people of this country we need to require police departments and states to provide public reports on all police shootings and deaths that take place while in police custody and the federal government should provide funding to help state and local governments adopt these new policing standards state and local governments participate in police reform should be rewarded by the federal government those who do not have federal justice funding withheld and very importantly we must militarize police departments around this country look at the television and it looks like there is an invading army looks like youre in iraq rather than looking at a local police department also got to establish standards and crack down on communities that are using their police forces essentially as revenue generators communities that receive an inordinate amount of the local funding fines and citations need to be stopped we have to deal with the level of policing in africanamerican communities across this country there is a strong sense many activists and others that i have spoken to their pr is over policing in some african american communities now i know that some will say thats because there is more crime in those poor black urban communities but if we jump to that conclusion we should examine recent bureau of justice statistics report examining the relationship between household poverty and non lethal violent victimization which includes rape sexual assault robbery aggravated assault and simple assault and this is what it found that the period studied from through people living in urban areas had violent victimization rates similar to poor people living in rural areas core urban blacks had rates of violence similar to poor urban whites represented vermont a rural state and i have to tell you that i do not see the level of intensity of policing that we seem to see in so many cities around the country now of course people committing violent crimes need to be apprehended tried by a jury of their peers and if they are convicted they need to go to jail nobody debates that we want criminals and people who are dangerous floor abiding people off the streets and let me also say and i say this is a former mayor somebody work very closely with the burlington vermont police department that took place authority of police officers in this country are honest they are working hard and they do a good job on the very very difficult circumstances however we cannot ignore the fact that the majority of people living in our cities are trying to work hard to play by the rules and to raise their children safely there are neighborhoods in this country and youll notice where mothers hard to believe in america but its true where mothers are afraid to let their children outside go outside for fear of gang violence and drugs and we owe it to those mothers to get dangerous people off the streets but mothers should not be afraid of their children being targeted by the police because of the color of their skin and that a routine interaction with law enforcement and in an appropriate force or even death we do not want any mobile in america have to worry about that but of course criminal justice reform goes well beyond reforming police departments we have to rethink our entire approach we cannot jail our way out of health problems like drug addiction or social and economic problems like poverty we must end the over incarceration of nonviolent young americans who do not pose a serious threat to our society africanamericans comprise fourteen percent of regular drug uses but all percent of those arrested for drug offenses from to about one in three adults arrested for drugs in the united states was africanamerican know how many think about this how many encounters between young people and the police begin with officers detecting the odor of marijuana unacceptable to me that we stigmatize so many young americans with a criminal record for possessing marijuana but at the same time not one major ceo of a wall street bank was illegal activities helped destroy the economy of the united states not one of them has a police record criminal justice system which says that a not only is a bank too big to fail but bankers to pick to jail and by the way all of that the fact that hundreds and hundreds of lines of young people have been destroyed because records for smoking marijuana and the fact that no ceos of wall street firms get police records all of this has a huge impact on peoples attitude toward the government justice upon fairness but in that regard our attitude toward marijuana must change im happy to tell you the live introduced legislation which takes marijuana off of the federal list of controlled substances it is frankly absurd under the controlled substances act that marijuana is a schedule drug alongside of heroin makes no sense at all to me so we want to get the federal government out of the business of making marijuana illegal if states want to go forward that is their right to do that and they should be able to do that without legal impediments from the federal government furthermore when we talk about reforming a broken criminal justice system we need to end prisons for profit introduced legislation to do that and as president i will make that happen it is simply wrong for corporations to be making profits through the incarceration of fellow americans or running detention centers that is not an area where people should be making profits furthermore have got to invest in drug courts and interventions for people with substance abuse problems our goal must be that people with substance abuse problems and by the way this is a huge problem from one end of this country that the other huge problem in my sleep because all you know not a drug problem we have a very serious problem with opiates and heroin is a problem all over america but what we must understand is that substance abuse is a disease not a crime and weve got a treated as a health issue and in that regard we have got to do a lot lot better with mental health in america we need a revolution in how we treat mental health when people want to get off at haringey heroin get off with opiates they should be able to get into a treatment center and get the care they need not have to wait but to use in addition we need to end mandatory minimum sentencing and give judges the discretion to better tailor sentences to the specific facts of a given case as you know judges often now do not have discretion the federal system of perot needs to be reinstated for people who are serving long sentences there needs to be an incentive for people to make different choices and earn their way to a shorter sentence and a path to a productive like people who committed crimes that ive landed them in jail there needs to be a pair back from prison and that includes a restoration of full voting rights i dont have to tell you that by and large we do a pretty bad job in making sure that when people are released from jail on end up in jail again clearly you dont have to be a criminologist understand that if somebody leaves jail without job training without education without money without housing the oslo that they will fall back into the same environment they got him in jail in the first place and that is a waste of human life and that is a huge waste of taxpayers dollars and we have got to end move away from over incarceration there are a number of systemic issues that we must address but let me just mention to them now first is the disparity in education for children in poor communities and poor communities of color in particular black children who make up just percent of preschoolers account of all out of school suspensions before kindergarten and not just tells you how systemic this problem is a leading black children be for kindergarten blacks were expelled at three times the rate of white children black girls were suspended at higher rates than all of the girls and most boys according to the department of education africanamerican students are more likely to suffer harsh punishments suspensions and arrest at school we must address the lingering on just stereotypes that lead us to label black youth sands bugs was super predators southern part of my state there was a principal shes retired was absolutely fierce and determined that kids in her high school would not drop out of school she would personally kill them if they dropped out of school she knew all of these kids she assigned menteur more available hours a day seven days a week sort of kid out of family problem at three oclock in the morning there was somebody that you could call it a kid was dealing with drugs or getting involved in that the mental was there the truth of the matter is if we are serious about keeping kids out of jail if we are serious about making sure our kids are in school or have jobs yes we can do that we do not need to allow millions of kids dont fall through the cracks to hang out on street corners to get into trouble down the jail and to see their lives destroyed we need to give all of our kids regardless of their income shot at attending college now my parents never went to college dad dropped out of high school my mother graduated high school and in our family which was lower middle class we dont know many people who want two cultures there are millions of kids in this country parents level at the college they dont know anybody who went to college and the idea of getting a higher education is about is meaningful to them is going to the moon and that is why i have introduced legislation and will make happen as president a process by which every public college and university in america is tuition free import well we know the obvious reasons why some people out of school deeply in debt and so forth but here is a more important but what should i think about it because it really is revolutionary sends is that every child in america weather in my home town of burlington vermont in columbia south carolina if you do your school work well if you pay attention if you are serious about school you will be able to go to college regardless of the income of your family millions objects and teaches will have hope and belief that they can make it into the middle class if they do well in school we have to stop the criminalisation of classroom misbehavior in this room by the video that we recently saw of the resource officer throwing a young girl across the room right here in south carolina there is a pipeline from school to jail that we have to turn into a pipeline from school to a promising future the second issue that we have got to deal with because all of these issues are interrelated have to be dealt with in a holistic model is the issue of poverty we are living today in the wealthiest country in the history of the world very few people know that because most of the well almost all of the well in almost all of the income being generated today goes to the top one percent we have seven million people in america living in poverty and shamefully and this is a total disgrace the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth twenty percent of markets close to forty percent of africanamerican kids now you tell me the justice of a society in which the top one tenth of one percent is almost as much well as the bottom tell me the justice of a society in which we are seeing a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires and yet we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth that is a disgrace that is not what america is supposed to be about and together we are going to end americans dont have ten thousand dollars in savings marginal wealthiest country in the history of the world majority of people in this country do not have what happens the other automobile accident what happens if you get sick what i and millions of americans age in the bank they have no clue as to how they gonna retire with dignity most black and latino households have less than three hundred and fifty dollars in savings the black unemployment rate has remained roughly twice as high as the white rate rate over the last years regardless of education let me tell you the story i guess im economists go to a study for me i asked them to tell me what the rate of real unemployment that is unemployment and underemployment for young people this countrys to graduated high school didnt drop out graduated high school this is what they said white kids percent latino kids thats an entire generation of kids graduating high school wanna get their feet on the ground want to get out of the house slot their adult lives not been out there for them so let me repeat it makes a lot more sense for us to invest in education and jobs rather than jails and incarceration will give you a long speech about how we deal with the collapse of the american middle class million people living in poverty but this is what i will tell you weve got to create millions of jobs in this country when we do it is by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure put thirteen million people back to work goodpaying jobs another thing that weve got to do is recognize let us minimum wage is a starvation wage got a raise the minimum wage to a living wage access terms not payday lenders you know the truth is that is very expensive to be poor you know what i mean by that a cashier check your paying outrageous sum of money not able to get a bank account in a normal bank we gotta change those things let me just conclude thank you all very much for holding this conference on an issue i get around the country all these issues that were talking about today are on the minds of millions and millions of americans not just africanamericans but the entire community we want to live in a nation in which were not spending eighty billion dollars a year locking up our neighbors we want to live in a nation where an africanamerican get in to his or her call and not worry about being dragged out of the call can be found dead three days later in a jail so we got a lot of work in front of us but this is an issue for my mind of enormous importance its an issue that we can and must work on together absolute confidence that when we come together this is an issue can be resolved thank youtoday the richest people in our country on more wealth than the bottom half of the american population hundred and fifty million people they know that the system is rigged when the average person is a girl hours wages and yet executives on wall street over the economic and political life of our country and most people though in the nineteen nineties and later the financial interests spend billions of dollars on campaign contributions to force through congress the deregulation of wall street the repeal of the glasssteagall act and the weekend of consumer protection was all across our country this money in order to get the government or their backs and to show the american people what they could do with this new one freedom from regulation well the short show the american people in the reckless this illegal behavior on wall street nearly destroy the american and global economy millions of americans lost their jobs they lost their homes and they lost their life savings while wall street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached the american middle class continues to disappear poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else continues to grow and wall street executives still receive compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened dishonesty and arrogance these are some of the words that best describe the reality of wall street today president political the wealthiest americans in this country at the expense of everyone else while president obama deserves credit for improving this economy to create a financial system and an economy that works for all our people not just a handful of billionaire mediumsized businesses create decent jobs continue the taxpayers of this country bailed out wall street because we were told that they were too big yesterday today three out of the four largest financial institutions jpmorgan chase bank of america and wells fargo are nearly then before we bailed them out because they would choose to fail six largest banks in this country issue than twothirds of all credit cards and woolen of all mortgages they controlled more than of all financial derivatives and hold more than of all bank deposits their assets today or equivalent to nearly of the geb of united states of america it is to risk perspective and the fear of another bellow it is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country the republican trust us were alive today he would say rain and he would be i will require the secretary of the treasury department to establish a too big to fail list of commercial banks and insurance companies fairly would pose a catastrophic risk to the united states economy without a tax bill o dog we need to do is commit to do as president of the united clicks something that would have been been under the glass steagle act president bill into precisely to prevent wall street speculators from closing another great depression for more than five decades untold wall street watered it down under president reagan and killed on the president clinton the federal reserve and the treasury department did josh banks as a result of an amendment that i ordered the emergency lending activities of the federal reserve during the financial crisis we learn that the fed provided more than six trillion dollars in shortterm lowinterest loans to every major financial institution in this country including citigroup jpmorgan chase bank of america wells fargo not to mention water corporations and banks and foreign central banks throughout the world secretary clintons we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry i disagree secretary of labor robert rice woes john wall street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of americans but what does break them up and resurrect the glass one separated investment from commercial banking hillary clinton says charge from a bit more and oversee them more carefully hillary clintons proposals only in shin and we all the way to contain the streets excess is so big bull in public they cant be watered down politicians to cut it out dissolution that is so spread is the understanding our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair and we do not have these kids and sometimes even jail for possessing or other minor crimes but when it comes to wall street executives some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country illegal behavior causes pain and suffering while millions of americans nothing happens to them million jobs home savings book for the ceo of wall street no no jail time no justice criminal justice system which room or does not dispense justice has ever been prosecuted for posing the nearcollapse of our entire economy will change on the ball or reaching settlements unfair and deceptive activities some people believe that this is an operation that we have an honest financial system in which every now and then major financial institutions do something wrong and court in my view the evidence suggests that would be incorrect and ours is the business model of wall street the role regulatory the likelihood is that wall street get away with a lot more illegal behavior we know how many times have we heard them if they have been wrong but it wasnt illegal let me help today major financial institutions in this country have been fined two hundred and four billion dollars two hundred billion dollars and that once again takes place in a week regulatory environment of when major banks were doing illegal active in august bank of america settled the case with the department of justice for more than sixteen billion dollars on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgagebacked securities it sold in the runup to the crisis in november of and jpmorgans suddenly case billion with the department of justice and the federal housing finance agency over charges that the bank knowing we sold securities madoff of lowquality mortgages to fannie mae and freddie mac of bnp paribas was sentenced to five years probation and was ordered to pay billion in penalties by r us district judge in manhattan after the bank pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in sudan i ran let me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it could possibly make sense was prosecuted just a few guidelines cnn headline may th big banks played by point four billion

launder billions from mexicos murderous drug gangs this article talks about how long coat which was a fired by wells fargo aidid mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money and this is what the federal prosecutors said about the city said i hope walked over leyton disregard for our banking laws international cocaine cartels virtual to finance their operations and yet the total fine with this offense was less than two percent of the banks billion dollar profit for and no one went to jail no one went to jail headline will street journal february jpmorgan apologize apologizes for military foreclosures here is a case where jpmorgan chase the largest bank in america wrecked the finances of military families in violation of the civil service members released back yet no one went to jail that the business model of wall street theres broad tax is not just talking that is what financial executives themselves told the university of notre dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year of wall street executives making more than a year founded likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market more than onethird of financial executives have evil witness firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace nearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful of financial executives have signed a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities here is bank of when he was caught trying to play trillion dollar per day currency market he said and i quote if you win you a truck and a quote last hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards letters and of course this country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of for fraud and corruption on wall street under my administration wall street ceos will no longer receive a get out of jail free card not be too big to fail big time bankers will not be too big to jail i will nominate and appoint people with a track record of sending off to power rather than those who have made millions defending wall street ceos this tax will not be represented in my administration creating to help the middle class of this and sound if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products and the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure your credit rating agencies do not make a profit from wall street credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triplea ratings ratings if that works for all americans we have got to financial institutions for ripping off the american people by charging skyhigh interest rates and outrageous fees that americans of four or five dollars in fees every time they go to an atm of charge people usury us interest rates we dont need the help flyer in the picture walks we dont need the rivers of roiling blood but we do need a national law banks credit unions the taxpayers of this country it is time to extend this cop to every lender at today you go to a payday lender interest rate of over percent drop into a vicious cycle of debt has gone millions of some of the most vulnerable people in this country postal office is exist in almost every community in our country one important way to provide dec banking opportunities for lowincome communities is to allow the united states postal service to engage in basic banking services on wall street the federal reserve acted with the fed will say both of us today that fear sense of urgency to come down unemployment and low wages to make more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary americans not just wall street has been hijacked by the very bank is it is in charge of regulating would be shocked to know their jamie dimon the ceo of jp served on the board of the new york fed at the same time that he received a three hundred and ninety one billion dollar bailout from the federal reserve conflict of interest that i will as president boxes to be guarding the hen house at the banking industry will be able to serve on the boards and handpick its members and special interest money out of the economy and parked at the fed excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the federal reserve have grown from less than two billion in points for trillian dollars today that is absurd instead of paying interest on these reserves should be charged a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create jobs will tell you or anyone else can effectively address crises facing the working families of this country alone no president can do it alone the truth is that wall street corporate america corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too what this campaign is building a political move which revitalizes american democracy which brings millions of people together black white latino asian american native american native and immigrant people enormous economic and political makes huge campaign contributions they have thousands of obvious and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them has an endless supply of money but we have something they dont have and that is when millions of working families together to make fundamental changes in our lives we have the power to bring about that change not just a handful of wealthy speculators and now more than ample that is exactly what we must do to you today is simple and straightforward if elected president i will rein in wall street so they cannot crash our economy again on wall street like the no thank you allthank all of you here this afternoon before i begin my remarks let me give you a very short thumbnail sketch of my political life because my journey here to washington d c has been a little bit different than many of my colleagues join mention i was born in brooklyn new york my father came to this country from poland at the age of without a penny in his pocket and without much of an educational i always think back about bravery was his as well as many other millions of people who came to this country with so little my mom graduated high school in new york city my dad worked for almost his entire life as a paint salesman and we were solidly lowermiddleclass my parents my brother and i believed in a small rentcontrolled apartment my mothers dream was to move out of that small apartment and i own a home of her own she died young and she never fulfilled that dream as a kid in many many ways i learnt a lot of money means to a family and that is a lesson i have never forgot my wife jane and i have been married for years we r for break loose and seven beautiful grandchildren and without trying to be overly dramatic about it what motivates me politically why i do what i do is to make sure that these kids and all of our children can live in a wonderful country and a wonderful world representing the great state of vermont join indicated the longestserving independent in american congressional history i served years in the house and vermonts lone congressman in a i was elected to the senate reelected in i began my rather unusual political career back in is a candidate for the us senate on a small third party called liberty and i received two percent of the world not dissuaded governor of the state of vermont and received one percent of all not be the brightest light on the block i ran again for the senate and received four percent of the vote two years later after governor and received sixty percent of the vote i thought i would give people want to break and i retired from politics in remembering one particular going said burning i promise i will vote for you if you promise that you will never run for office again in i was persuaded by some friends to run for mayor of burlington the largest city in our state against the fiveterm democrat democratic mayor i ran as an independent nobody but nobody thought we had a chance to win we do not very remarkable election we put together an extraordinary coalition of workers and trade unionists of environmentalists of neighborhood activist lowincome organizations of womens groups of college students and that type of coalition politics are bringing people together around a progressive agenda changed my view of politics today in a campaign which costs about i the people who supported me not on thousands of doors in the city and let me tell you it gets cold in vermont in march on election night when the votes were counted we want the working class once by something like two to one and won the election by all of boats it was the biggest political upset in modern history and after reading the margin of victory was reduced to goals without going into any great lengths to your local office with out of the members of the city council democrats and republicans in very strong opposition to my agenda and trust those of you in this room think the president obama has gotten a rough time for republicans that was nothing compared to what i am i supported experience during my first journal but one year later of what we were attempting to do and what we wanted to do a slate of candidates working with me defeated a number of the incumbent obstructionists a year after that election in which the voter turnout was almost double what it was when i was first elected i pretty easily defeated democratic and republican candidates continue to get reelected in my last election defeated a candidate from both political parties i ran for the us congress in a threeway race i came in second with thirty eight percent of the vote two years later won election percent of winning with over percent more than my opponent in with retirement of senator jim jeffords and with the support of them i one per month senate seat to go to the wealthiest person in the state of vermont a candidate who spent three times more money than anyone had ever spent before and ill say just three and already very very negative rates i want with percent of the vote in a reelection with as mayor of burlington my administration took on virtually every special and powerful interest in the city and in the state against the wishes of developers and the railroads we created a beautiful people oriented waterfront and a bike path along the way they champlain we developed the first municipal housing land trusts in the country for a portable housing we won national recognition berlin beautification by planting thousands of trees throughout the city and we make major improvements in our streets and sidewalks we implemented the largest environmental program then in the states history by building a new wastewater facility for that untreated waste going into the lake we sought to use laws which created a beautiful day casts a little program after school programs and a team set up all of which continue to exist today with the first city in vermont to break its dependence on the regressive property tax we made major changes in burlington police dept moving in the direction of community policing we saw a very active and successful loss program and womens council results for the last several decades burlington has been considered to be one of the most beautiful and livable cities in america all of you not only the business burlington but the visit of beautiful state of vermont became first independent elected to the us house and forty years and during my first year there along with four other house members of the congressional progressive caucus which sounds today its one of the largest and most important caucuses in congress doing a great job representing the working of our country one of the first votes in the house that i cast was against the first gulf war i believe that history will record that that was the white vote as well foreign policy blunders in the modern history of our country and also created a situation where today hundreds of thousands men and women have come home from iraq and afghanistan with posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury home without the law with arms and legs and their eyesight and that is the course before we get involved in another war we remember what is really about i was one of those against regulation supported by both republican and democratic leadership in retrospect i think it is fair to say that most people today do not believe that it was a great idea to end class and to allow the greed recklessness in illegal activity on wall street to go unchecked written by corporate america again supported by democratic to republican presidents agreements like nafta permanent normal trade relations with china and other trade agreements which have cost us millions of decent paying jobs and have led this country to a race to the ball i strongly oppose the transpacific partnership trade house took on the pharmaceutical industry and the outrageous prices they charge our people and became the first member of congress to take americans across the canadian auto to purchase prescription drugs there and i will never forget that trip where women struggling with press cancel the medicine they need for in montreal in the united states by understanding today hundreds of thousands of people have to continue buying them medicine in canada rather than the local is the chairman of the senate veterans committee i worked hard in a bipartisan way to pass the most significant veterans legislation passed in many many years this legislation over fifteen billion dollars into improving veterans healthcare into making certain that the people who put their lives on the line to defend us get the best quality health care possible and get it in a kindly man and i have wonderful it is to have been the recipient of the highest awards from both the american legion and vfw and i am very grateful to them for that someone wanted to learn about health care and our dysfunctional health care system i worked hard with representative jim clyburn to put some twelve billion dollars in federally qualified community health centers which resulted in some four million lowerincome americans lowerincome americans gaining access to health care dental care prescription drugs and mental health counseling we also significantly expand the national health service goal to provide debt forgiveness for new primary care physicians the president was very supportive of these efforts in my view this program is one of the one of these success stories of the affordable care around as one of the leaders in the center trying to combat the global crisis of climate change wont i hope past the energy efficiency block grant program which put billions of dollars into energy efficiency and sustainable and working with several of my colleagues i found the defending social security costs us and we were successful in beating back to try to cut programs cut social security benefits with the same old veterans from some of the most powerful people in this country and thats enough i will continue to make brief description of political history let me go to something more important and that is the future of our country and what i tell you now i suspect not too many people who come up here well talk about but as somebody who has been described as a rugby grandfather to schiphol guys on capitol hill i have to live up to my reputation so i really rough today in a nation plagued by many many concerns the most serious problem we face is the protest growing level of wealth profound moral issue is a profound economic issues and as a result of citizens united it is a profound political this is the issue all other job creation and infrastructure tax reform health care climate change the environment education barbosa fundamentally impact impacted by income and well let me tell you what very few elected officials and that is that given the incredible power of the billionaire class over the economic like this country over politics over me i am absolutely convinced that the struggle economically and social justice their struggle for a strong middle class struggle for a vibrant democracy in which elections on not bought by the wealthy will not be one you know like a lesson unprecedented grassroots movement is the fellow which is prepared to take on and defeat the power of the members of congress of those fifty years ago and many other standing outside of martin luther king small and modest tax revenue church in montgomery i was reminded that real change never takes place without trouble without the active participation of millions of people who are prepared to stand up and fight for justice of people who in fact are prepared to put their lives on line in those topics the political battle of our time is not republicans versus democrats it is not the political games inside the beltway that preoccupy much of the medias attention it is not the only thirty second tbs deployed our airwaves the political struggle of this moment in our history is declining middle class of millions of people working longer hours for low wages if they are lucky enough to have tools against the power of a billionaire class greed has no end it is the struggle in american black white hispanic asian native american women and men and the income to take care of their families struggling for retirement security struggling for a decent education for their kids probably by helmet cam broadly what dignity against the greed of a few on top apparently want it all of you know for the last forty years the great middle class of our country once the envy of the entire world despite exploding technology just like increased productivity despite the global economy and the increasing trade millions of americans today are working longer hours for low wages and we have more people living in poverty today that almost any time in the modern history of america today real unemployment is not by real unemployment is percent if you include those workers will given up looking for work or working time when they want to work full time employment is almost and african american youth unemployment is law the highest rate of trial the property of any major country on earth and despite the modest successful affordable care act million americans continue to have no health insurance while even more are under heavy copayments or deductibles in their trucks policies we remain today in the only major country on earth that does not guarantee healthcare all people and that is came to my mind the occupy wall street movement consider themselves as to why we are and why they since middleclass down by almost after adjusting for inflation the median male work with a less last year than he did years ago despite an explosion of technology and productive today than we were six years ago when bush left office of course but anyone who does not understand the suffering in the middle class and working families about country are experiencing today and sometimes thats my perception of capitol hill here in capitol hill and the rest of the country i think its imperative that we close that gap begin whats going on with the working families of this country while the middle class continues to disappear the wealthiest people in the largest corporations like doing phenomenally well and the gap between the very very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider and white top one percent now only fortyone percent of the entire wealth of this country while the bottom sixty percent loans last then today credibly the top percent now as much well as the bottom david walker billion dollars more wealth than the bottom forty percent of the american big the fact of the matter is over the last forty years we have witnessed the robin hood principal a reverse an enormous transfer of wealth from the middle class and the pool the multi millionaires and billionaires in share of the nations well to the bottom was percent in down to just if the bottom simply maintain the same share as it did years ago you would have more than trillion dollars well is currently the case today we are doing today which is percent increase their share of more than a trillion dollars since the great wall street collapse of all is going to the top one percent of people all over this country struggle they were out to feed their kids they send their kids to college childcare worried about their parents generated unless goes to the top one percent very rich get richer and everybody else gets poorer and public school is supposed to be i dont think so that piece of legislation every piece of legislation on behalf of the wealthy corporations tell you you dont know whats going on in washington according to media reports it appears that the koch brothers are prepared to spend more money in the next election that either the democratic or republican parties in other words one of the second wealthiest families this country worth approximately a hundred billion dollars may well have a strong political presence of the major from a recent political company thats developing detailed state of the art profiles on million americans giving the brothers political operation all the earmarks of a national network inhouse expertise in polling message testing advertising media buying groups and automates and mastery of election law corporate line that aggressive and usurpation experimentation operation actually exceeds republican national committees dollar operation because they will only get wrong i want everyone in this room right wing political power of the two major political parties in this country what is the political system well i think it is not cold democracy it is cold oligarchy and that is the system we are rapidly moving and that is a system we must vigorously improving economy jobs crisis what we do we need to rebuild ill probably a trillion dollar piece of legislation roads bridges airports water by the way support the creation of million decent paying jobs minimum wage here at the federal level is a starvation wage we need to raise over a period of years to an hour nobody working hours a week in this country should wear activity regulate the six largest financial institutions assets of sixty percent of gdp president today you know what he wants a break them off and he would we want to break off the united states is the only major country healthcare program almost twice as much per capita it is time for america character every man woman at roper public colleges to try to cut social security medicare medicaid needless to say i strongly disagree weve got to expand social security not real tax reform it is not acceptable that major corporation if the major corporation taxes will lose a hundred billion a year in revenue because these companies money in the cayman islands bermuda the tax havens for these large corporations to rejoin america contribute and by the way my election campaigns i think the average contribution and i dont do is fund raising money and i was thinking if i was really enormous lee success million people a million dollars that would be an enormous sum of money onethird of what the koch brothers themselves so those caucuses with the democrats if you ran with you run as a democrat would you run as an independent right question getting bolder and bolder and grey or gray ill try to think through all these republican values the republican party has moved from a moderate centrist party to a rightwing extremist once the body of the american working class nobody was very few people perceive it to be the case anymore and people more and more people all over this country are looking for alternatives to bodies thats one of the reasons why one might wonder whats the negative as you all know it is awfully hard to run as a candidate united billionaire billionaire how do you put together how outside how you get invited to the base of all due respect to the media gotta follow somebody was running as an independent not to be in some cases literally impossible to get on the battle is the third party so those are the issues we are also trying the democrats anyway theyre really makes you an independent are you really a democrat my discussion first victory was defeating the fiveterm democrat defeated democrats and republicans for many many years this is what i think i think we have a political system right now which i mentioned earlier this is not the party of the white tees up david eisenhower and theres no way obviously focus without i think within the democratic party you have some great people you have some really really good people often dont get the credit they deserve a mention the progressive caucus in the house many progressive in the senate working night and day for working families so to me given a member of the senate democrats republicans so theres not much question about which caucus would be enough i want to thank the democratic leadership in the senate for treating with very very very decently but to my mind theres no question but the democrats of all probable to the republicans on the issues that concern if you if you were elected how would you work with congress there seems to be gridlock between the white house and congress now with that be the same case if you were in the white house is not because of the socalled gridlock every member of congress has a personality defect and is unable to communicate with people in the political party whether people and that hehe everybody around it just gets this is what is the case is right now but the united states congress is represented of where the american people out of touch the american people say raise the minimum wage tax breaks for billionaires american people say we have to move towards sustainable clean energy and energy efficiency united states congress says the keystone pipeline and on and on and that is a very important for sure what happened up a lot of respect and personal affection climbed away and his contemporaries and i think that is a politician one campaigns of los only this but if you would ask me what use major mistake has been is that he thought that after putting this extraordinary grassroots movement of workingclass people and getting elected to the presidency and then he thought he could sit down with republicans and negotiate all these fine agreements he was the only way that any president taking on the billionaire class can succeed the only possible way is to mobilize people to say the congress guess what this is what you ought to you all gonna raise the minimum wage you all gonna create millions of jobs you all gonna protect our veterans and i will see you youre not going to get tax breaks for the rich you all gonna make college and we are watching you and if you know who this legislation youre not going to return to lowes what i will say with certain that if we continue on how the elections in with percent of the people dont vote eighty percent of which will only get richer and will continue to dominate what goes on here so to answer your question any serious president to watch represent working mens hostel mobilize people all over this country to make the congress they cant refuse to run against them it would be like to debate the serious issues facing our country as intelligent people should be going on and let me say this again this is how i always get myself in trouble why we cant have that if the media that instead of political let us talk about the real issues and respect different points of view but when sixtythree percent of the people in a poll last year which political parties control the house and the senate something is wrong political consciousness in this country so what we need simple intelligent debate on the real issues they see the american people not more political gossip who slipped on a banana peel who said something so i did today but how do we transforming our energy system so we can save the planet from climate change how do we do with a level not easy stop how do we do those are the issues that serious people total transparency people like yourself should talk about one person we have in the industrialized about people unemployed today are you gonna put those people back to work but are you worried that so few people have so much political power those are questions i dont hear very much about so it turns out i dont know a whole lot of you know i know what you know about the rules are quite frankly from the polls in person at the front desk im gonna close are we getting on hillarys emails in washington dec president and what do you think about the push by republicans to have the federal audit i was involved in dog friend for the first time in the history of the united states passed i didnt tired but during the financial crisis i think they found out during the financial crisis six trillion sixteen trillion dollars was led out to portray the every financial institution major financial institution in the united states and central banks all over the world and yet working families today have to figure out how to pay seven or eight percent interest rates with their kids to go to college maybe we should practice lowinterest loans for working families and those greedy financial institutions in terms of that is legislation to live without heres an example of strange bedfellows all of which we managed to pass the fed doesnt make sense to me defense in were running short of time so try to combine a few of them and you can jump in cuba pose two wars in iraq and afghanistan if you were president how would you have responded to the attacks of september thats one question and another questioner notes that you are a big advocate of cutting defense spending yes this person also believes your supporter of the f program which has come under criticism is being wasteful so how do you reconcile that still f in september first voted no but i did and the reason i did it obviously we knew pretty good idea attack on opposed the war in iraq and i think is too difficult a simple things that happen but this is what we have been iraq and afghanistan over the course of the war in human life as a very very long at some of my colleagues help in getting us that was in the quagmire of middle east and i will do my best to oppose right now what you have is a situation where is an example saudi arabia country control multibillion dollar one of the wealthiest families in the world turns out that saudi arabia has the fourth largest military budget in the world now why gods name is the united states contemplating sending complex rules into iraq again when you got the sort of sitting there watching us do that i think what you have now in the middle east is in fact the sole of his slumping will it be the peaceful religion believe it will be a nice and i think it is absolutely saudi arabia jordan for the countries in that region to get actively involved in the effort against the united states and western europe should be supportive but i do not believe that the united states should leadbringing forth but the daytoday work that you were doing in terms of job training in terms of helping small businesses secure financing and contracts and the help that you provided families with counseling when they are trying to realize the american dream of homeownership and that just a few of the areas that you have excelled in a little bit different than others i am the longestserving independent in the history of the united states congress and i am running for president of the united states today within the democratic primary and caucus process it is my belief from the bottom of my heart i would not be running for president if i thought otherwise that given the enormous crisis that this country faces today crises that may be more severe than any time since the great depression of the nineteen thirties that frankly it is too late for establishment policies it is too late for establishment politics it is too late for establishment economics we need some new thinking some bold thinking and most importantly this may make some people nervous i think when we have a nation today where a handful of billion as unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country there is nothing significant that we will accomplish unless we have the courage to take them on and that is what this campaign is about that you have outline for this conference are exactly right save our cities education jobs and justice as i get into those things look first point that i want to make is perhaps the most important and i do understand that was some people this is uncomfortable but i believe it has to be addressed and that is that the united states of america twoday country in the history of the world what most people dont know that because much of that well is concentrated in the hands of a few today in america we have more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on earth and it is worse today than at any time since to me it is not acceptable that the top onetenth of one percent owns almost as much well as the bottom it is not acceptable that one family family that owns more wealth than the bottom of the american people it is not acceptable in the last two years the wealthiest people saw their wealth increased by a hundred and fifty seven billion dollars more well that is owned by the bottom one hundred and thirty million americans the truth of the matter is that we can not run away from that reality income and wealth inequality is the great moral issue of our time it is a great economic issue of our time it is the great social and political issue of our time and to get up we must address that issue a few days ago former president jimmy carter described the american political system as corrupt he described the united states as an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nomination for president elected president what he was talking about is the disastrous supreme court decision in citizens united decision which says the wealthiest people in this country you already own the economy now were going to give you the opportunity to buy the united states government that decision is undermining the very foundations of american democracy what men and women have fought and given their lives to defend you tell me what it means when one family the koch brothers family will spend more money on this election cycle than either the democratic party or the republican party spent almost a billion dollars to buy candidates will make the rich richer and everyone else floral dr me is not democracy that is key thats what weve got to overturn this disastrous citizens united decision and i guarantee you that all of the issues the candidates have talked about that you believe it will not take place when a handful of wealthy people are able to control our political system now when we talk about education i trust that all of you know is that we live in a highly competitive global economy to my mind it is insane and i use that word advised that we have hundreds of thousands of bright young people often minorities who have the desire to have the ability to get a higher education and go to college but they cant go to college for the simple reason their families cannot afford the tuition that is absurd we need to have the best educated workforce in the world and not tell hundreds of thousands of bright young people that they cannot make it into the middle class ladylike cannot contribute as engineers as doctors aside this and that is why i will fight for its president to make every public college and university in america and what that means is that kids in the fourth grade and in the sixth grade will know that if they study hard pay attention to their school work even if their parents like my parents did you go to college kids in the neighborhood did not go to college they will be able to go to college because the incomes of their families will not be a determining factor this will revolutionize education i think and when we talk about education but we also have to understand to be frank is the world has changed since the nineteen forties and fifties mom is in the workplace dad is in the workplace we need a firstclass childcare prek in this country in my state and all over this country working class families struggling to find affordable quality child care child care workers are paid minimum wage that is not how we treat the most vulnerable children in america universal prek teacher obviously a word about jobs you read every month that unemployment is percent government comes out with a statistic please know that that statistic is only one of many statistics the government releases are drops that statistic does not include those people were given up looking for work and those people working parttime millions when they want to work full time real unemployment is that it is it is a crisis and ill let me tell you what very few people are talking about which is an even greater crisis and ideas youth unemployment which we dont talk about at all i ask paul asked the study for an economic policy and and they came up with the results that nobody is questioning lets do this if you are a white kid between and graduates high school you have a percent unemployment right if you are an hispanic did you have a percent unemployment rate if you are an africanamerican kids seventeen to twenty high school graduate have a percent unemployment rate that is unacceptable that is turning our backs on an entire generation and we must not allow that to continue now when people talk about but ratcheting up the united states having more people in jail than any other country including china one of the contributing factors is that we got five and a half million young people that america in my state in your states without education hanging around on street corners doing bad things it is a very strong opinion that it makes a lot more sets for us to be investing in jobs and education rather than jails and it cost inflation along with representative john conyers i introduced legislation that would create one million jobs over the next several years for unemployed and that is why i have introduced legislation that calls for a trillion dollar investment in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure creating thirteen million decent paying jobs and when we talk about jobs and income let me be very clear to minimum wage that exists nationally is in my view a starvation wage and that is why the last week alongside the fast food industry was standing up and fighting for dignity i introduced the legislation that will move us to an hour minimum wage over the next few years has done a lot of good things but we should understand that the united states today remains the only major country on earth does not guarantee health care of all people as a right and that is why i will continue fighting and introduce legislation for a medicare for all singlepayer program guaranteeing health care every man woman and trial justice when we talk about the need for all people in america to be treated equally and with dignity weve got a deal with some hard realities and those realities include the fact that today if you can believe it and i know uk one in four black males today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime unless we change that dynamics this is an unspeakable tragedy and this country can no longer ignore that blacks are in prison at six times the rate of whites a report by the department of justice found that blacks what three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop compared to white motorists africanamericans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience to use of thoughts during encounters with police in this is an extraordinary figure i think not an accident thirteen percent of africanamerican men have lost the right to vote due to felony convictions cant participate in the democratic political process now in my view we need some major changes in criminal justice in america and is president of the united states i promise you my justice will be vigorous in fighting all forms of discrimination in every area of our life not only in police matters but in housing in credit in every area it impacts minority populations across our nation is all of you know and we see almost every day too many africanamericans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system there treat citizens who have not committed crimes as if they were criminals a growing number of communities throughout this country do not trust the police and police have become disconnected from the communities they are sworn to protect what i was mayor of burlington vermont the largest city in the state one of the things that we did and i believe this very strongly as we move toward community policing community policing means that police are part of the community not seen as a presses in the community and that is the direction that weve got to move cidre bland michael braun rickie avoid a ricardo walter scott pretty great to me rice samuel most we know their names each of them died at the hands of police offices or in police custody let us all be very clear violence and brutality of any kind particularly at the hands of law enforcement sworn to protect and serve their communities is unacceptable and must not be tolerated we must reform our criminal justice system black lives do matter and we must value black lights we must move away from the militarization of police forces have all seen on tv this heavy duty equipment looks like theyre invading the city going to war and that is not the signal that police should be sending around this country believes should be part of the community not an impressive plus we need a justice department which takes the lead in working with states and localities to train police offices for us should be the last resort not the first resort what people who have committed crimes that ive landed them in jail there needs to be a path back to prison the recidivism rate in this country is incredibly high people go to jail jobs they have no money they have the housing and then we are when they end up in jail we must end the overcoat oscillation violent young americans who do not pose a serious threat to our society it is an international embarrassment that we have more people in jail than any other country it is obscenity that we stigmatize so many young americans with a criminal record for smoking marijuana but not one major wall street exact it has been prosecuted for causing the deal collapse of our entire economy doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me we need to end prisons for profit i do not want corporations making money and more money based on how many people we lost off of serious a defective warrant should not be how many people go to jail but how many people we can keep out of jail we need to invest in drug court and medical and mental health interventions mental health what so many people in jail are dealing with mental health issues that i can tell you as a senator i get calls i think others who was well senator my brother im worried what hes going to do it himself to other people we searched desperately for affordable mental health care we cant find it thats going on all over america that is a story that has to change we have to take a hard look and the tragedy last month in south carolina reminds me of that so strongly that there are still those who seek to terrorize and they all terrorists the africanamerican community with violence and intimidation some of us thought that i had ended fifty years ago but it hasnt we need to make sure that federal resources are available to crack down on the illegal activities of hate groups there are hundreds of groups in this country sole reason for existence is hatred of africanamericans hatred of immigrants hatred of jews hatred of catholics that has got to end of the federal government must be active in ending that brothers and sisters thank you very much for allowing me to be with you and share some ideas and let me conclude maybe in the tone that i began and that is very very difficult days no question about it but i believe that if we stand together as a people if we dont let people divide us by race gender sexual orientation by what country we will if we stand together if we have the courage to take on those people today whose greed is destroying america we do that there is nothing that we cannot accomplishlike you thank you to lose and let me let me begin by saying that we have done rallies all over this country and weve had great people trade unionist environmentalists womens advocate introducing us but i have never heard people young people the kinds of introductions and statements that hurt the night into sun and what it tells me and raul raul made this point what it tells me is that when we stand together as white black and latino and native american and asian american when we stand together there is nothing that can stop us from transforming this country and let me just thanking congressman raul grijalva not only for his friendship with so many years not only for his coat chairmanship of the progressive caucus by four but for his decades of fighting for civil rights for all of how much we all were the first americans and then we will protect them that young man bob della rosa and rugby thank those who are young ladies maria isabel maria teresa if we know that wonderful rendition of the national anthem frankly it is hard to follow in the footsteps of these young people beautiful young people make us all so proud now i asked by the media why it is that we are tracked turn out like this why so many people in tucson around tonight by people are out in boston last week people couple of months ago were out in portland oregon the media is asking happening that we are raising money without a super pac we were all told we were all closed all of the political experts said that the only way you can compete its by picking millionaires and billionaires and super pacs for money we said no and our campaign has received six hundred and fifty thousand individual contributions and the average contribution and theres warms my heart the average contribution is not two thousand its not fifty thousand it is a person this is not a billion and when the media ask how is all of this happening who is going to respond to the call for a political revolution it turns out that the people in tucson and people all over this country are prepared to stand up to israel set and make sure and make sure that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of billion that the american people are sick and tired of establishment politics they are sick and tired of establishment economics the people of this country understand that almost all of the new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent and the american people are saying loud and clear we want an economy that works for workers not the very rich and the american people understand that as a result of the citizens united supreme court decision you know about citizens united that as a result of that decision our campaign finance system our political system is totally corrupt and american democracy is being under budget before i get into the thrust of my remarks i wanted to take a brief moment to tell you what i expect most of you already know and that is the today on two campuses in our country one at texas southern university student was shot and killed and one was wounded and as you know in your own state northern arizona state university in plex left one student was killed and three were wounded now goes without saying it goes without saying that our condolences go to the families of those who were killed in our hearts and prayers go out for a full recovery but those that were wounded but we also know that we are tired of condolences and we are tired of just press we are tired and we are in paris in picking up the paper or turning on the tv and seeing children in elementary schools lauded and young people on college campuses and the truth of the matter is i wish i could tell you other was the issue of gun violence is not gonna be solved easily but just beat callers it is not going to be solved easily does not mean that we do not address it and do the best we can i can stay later ramon like you and i invite you all up early in the summer and will come here in the website is that i come from a slate which has a history going back to its very creation of people owning guns hunting doing target practice but the truth and having virtually no gun control at all today but what the people of vermont understand is that we need to have a serious conversation and stop the yelling and the meaning of all people involved in this issue overwhelmingly the american people understand that it is crazy that people who should not all guns guns they are all too well nearly that not only we do we need to strengthen the instant background check we need to broaden it as well and they understand that it makes no sense that we have a loophole in the law so that people can go to gun shows and by weapons without having to go through the instant background check people understand thats wrong and i just got to church and there are many people in this country who do not why we are selling and distributing allowing to be distributed assault weapons which child only one function and that is the killing of people and people do not understand why we do not have legislation to prevent people from buying guns legally what they sell again to criminals was so close strong min situation and also what people dont understand is that in my state it all over this country they are all people who are experiencing severe emotional problems all over this country we have thousands of people who are suicidal or homicidal what they cannot get the help they need when they need it a revolution in mental health delivery in this country somehow if you are involved in an automobile accident in your hurt you get rushed to an emergency rule and you get good care people save you like but if you are suffering a mental breakdown and you are suicidal or homicidal you may not be able to find the care you need because there are doctors or counselors available or you cannot afford that but i think while yes there are disagreements over how we go forward in terms of gun safety i think the vast majority of the american people want us to goof ball in sensible way which keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have that a clutch down on these senseless murders that we see every week and let me also say a word on an issue that i know is obviously of enormous consequence all over this country but maybe more and arizona than in many other areas and that is the issue of immigration reform and let me begin by saying i know a little bit about immigration my father came to this country at the age of from poland he came to this country not speaking a word of english came to this country without a nickel in his pocket and he never made a whole lot of money i grew up in a three and a half room rate controlled apartment in brooklyn new york and my mothers dream was that someday maybe our family would own home and not have to rent that never happened she died young and her dream never came to pass but my parents both of them were enormously proud my father may be especially to see his two sons go to college and he enjoyed the opportunities that america gave him in there was no prouder american young man who came to this country at the age of my familys story is the story very similar to many people who are here tonight and that story is the story of america it is the story of hardworking families coming into this country to create a brighter future for their children it is a story rooted in family and fueled by hope it is a story that continues to this day in families all across our country today is everyone here knows we have eleven million people in this country who are undocumented who came to this country to improve their lives to escape oppression fleeing desperate poverty and violence lets be frank todays undocumented workers play an extraordinarily important role in our economy where our workers it is likely that our outlook cultural system would collapse and dock workers are doing the hardest work in this country they all our crops building our homes cooking meals caring for our kids they are fabric of this country million people came to this country so they could feed their families escape gang violence and desperate economic circumstances let me also be very clear that people came to this country because they know that there were jobs and if anyone thinks that employers throughout america didnt know that the workers they were hiring undocumented they would walk that is the reality of where we employers were complicit hiring undocumented workers for low wages thats the fact of wages alright let me tell you a little story if i might lack in as the senator from vermont i went to a place called immokalee florida anybody know what is unique about immokalee florida small town near naples thats where they grow postal the tomatoes lowgrade tomatoes used by mcdonald burger king i went there on the day that i visited just coincidentally the usa eternity whats bringing charges against a contract or for slavery in two thousand and seven people were being held in voluntarily to work in the fields and i saw their working conditions and the exploitation that these workers experience and i saw her rent does housing that they lived in and im happy to tell you that we are hearing on this issue in washington we made some progress wages went up working conditions went off while there are many immokalee all over this country where undocumented workers all be exploited and when you explore the people who cannot defend themselves when you exploit people by paying low wages what you are doing is creating a race to the bottom for every worker in america let me tell you something else people can have disagreements about immigration reform but in the year it is not acceptable stooping to racism and demagoguery in order to win some political goals it is not acceptable it is american should be defining a whole group of people come from mexico and calling them criminals and rick warehouse for so hard in this country for hundreds of years to end racism discrimination in to that kind of ugly language in two thousand and thirteen i proudly supported comprehensive immigration reform legislation that passed the uss said it now this is not what i do not the provisions of the dream act which strongly support and which would offer the opportunity of permanent residency and eventual citizenship to young people who are brought to the united states as children by believe that we should recognize the young men and women who comprise the dream is for what they are american kids who deserve the right to legally be in the country where chance that home senate bill was far from perfect but at least it began the process of moving us in the right direction it is beyond my comprehension that the house of representatives has not yet even be the discussion on immigration its hurting a racism maybe they want to deal with this issue in a serious way we cant pass comprehensive immigration reform we must be as aggressive as we can in pursuing policies that are you made and sensible and that keep families together and this includes taking measures that are currently available including using the presidential power of executive orders when appropriate while the senate passed the dream act in its immigration bill and while the house has not yet acted i think president obama did exactly the right thing there is executive lloyd but deferred action for childhood arrivals daca disclosed was a good first step but should be expanded deferred action should be expanded to include the parents of citizens parents of legal permanent residence and the parents of drinkers our job is to families together not tear them apart when we talk about issues facing this country be ongoing violence beyond immigration we are talking about the fact that in the united states today we have boy income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth and it is worse today in america than at any time since let me be very clear there is something profoundly wrong in this country when the top one tenth of one percent all almost as much well as the bottom that is not what america is supposed to be about there is something profoundly wrong went in our results are in vermont and all over this country people are working three jobs people are working incredible hours in order to put food on the table and yet of old new income is going to the top one percent thats look there is something wrong in this country went in recent years we have seen a proliferation of millions and billions as yet we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country are there is something wrong when in the last two years the wealthiest people in this country fourteen people have seen their wealth increase by a hundred and fifty six billion dollars well that is sold by the bottom million americans what this campaign is about sending a message to the billionaire class and that message is you cannot have it all to the greedy is that you get more tax breaks children in america go hungry you are not going to provide compensation packages to the ceos of large corporations at the same time cutting the health care and the wages and pensions workers not just the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality it is about the fact that yes we are a lot better off economically today than we were when bush left office thats true you know my republican friends suffer from the disease short term amnesia oil their views the barack obamas closed every problem in the history of the world yet they took seven years ago people of monks were losing their jobs they seem to have forgotten that the worlds financial system as a result of the greed and recklessness on wall street was on the verge of collapse and they seem to forget great deficit hawks that they were in the bush we ran up the largest deficit in the history of america but while we are better off today than we were seven years ago there is no the truth and that is for the last forty years the great middle class of this country has been disappearing what we have seen in recent years an explosion of technology workers big fall more productive as yet most of all people are working longer hours for low wages what we have seen is median family income in this country going down by four thousand dollars since what we have seen is male workers the average male worker the middle of the economy making hundreds of dollars less than he did forty years ago in women making less today than they did seven years ago what political revolution that we are involved is about yet we are going to create an economy that works for all of us and not just the people on top lot talked about enough real unemployment in this country if you include those people have given up looking for work in the media or working parttime percent it is and now let me tell you something that very few people talk about and i did the crisis of youth unemployment in this country couple of months ago i asked some economist to do a study for me and i asked them to tell me what real youth unemployment and underemployment was for high school graduates not dropouts high school graduates between the ages of and and this is what they told me for white kids real unemployment or latino kids real unemployment for african american kids real unemployment you know the words we are turning our backs on a generation of young people who want to stand up on their own two feet they want to earn some money they want to get out of the house they want to begin their lives as adults and what we are saying to them there are no jobs available for you but let me tell you something else that we are saying to these young people today in america we have more people in jail than any other country on earth million people in jail disproportionately black and latino now it seems to me when you have youth unemployment at thirty forty or fifty percent maybe just maybe it makes sense to invest in education and jobs there is a promise is a promise i dont make a whole lot of campaign promises you got one here tonight if elected president the united states of america will not have more people in jail than any other country where send our young people to jobs and school not and when we talk about the economy in america today and when we talk about white people working such long hours so many jobs it has everything to do with the fact that wages in america are just too low as all of you know the federal minimum wage is an hour the arithmetic as well as i kept you about the boy suffered a quarter or like hours a week weeks a year and what you end up with is not enough money to take care of a family and that is why i believe that the minimum wage has got to be raised to a living wage and what we talked about fair wages i hope every man here will stand with the women and fight but pay equity for women workers there is no rational economic reason why women are earning cents on the dollar compared to ban it is simply sexism its got it now in the in the campaign season we often hear a whole lot about family values republican family values about families by you all know that when republicans talk about family values what they are talking about is their belief that women in this country should not have the right to control their own bodies i disagree about family values what they are talking about is that our gay brothers and sisters should not have the right to get married my wife jane just been and i have been married for years we have four great kids and seven beautiful grandchildren we believe in family values but theyre not republican family values at the top of my list of family values for the united states to end the international embarrassment of being the only nature country on earth that does not guarantee paid family medical leave when a workingclass woman has a baby she should not be forced to go back to work a week or two weeks after the birth of that baby and that its while i believe that our country has got to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee at least three months up a family of medically brothers and sisters when we talk about the economy what is always on peoples minds is the issue of jobs jobs jobs people on dissent how difficult it is to go out and get a job that pays a living wage well it seems to me that have real unemployment is if you thought employment is thirty forty or fifty percent the united states government must undertake a massive federal jobs program to put millions of people back door i want to see this country hiring teachers not firing i want to cities and towns higher ii trial care workers so that our kids get the quality child care they need and went our infrastructure our roads our bridges water systems rail airports levees and dams are collapsing all over this country i want to see millions of workers getting back to work rebuilding and when we talk about the economy we cannot help but talk about the greed and fraud and dishonesty and arrogance of those who work on wall street all of you know that as a result of the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street this country was driven into the worst economic downturn since the nineteen thirties what some of you may not know you may not know this but today fool largest banks are much larger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail when we have six banks in this country are showing twothirds of the credit cards and over of all mortgages in my view when you have a six large banks that have a six equivalent to percent of the gdp of this country when you have banks that are too big to fail in my view they are too big to exist weve got a break them up i want to see financial system where credit unions and community banks are out there making loans to small and mediumsized businesses not all wall street which long island unto itself overly concerned about their profits brothers and sisters when we talk about whats going on in this country today there is one issue which impacts every of the issue and that is five years ago the united states supreme court rules through citizens united that billions and billions as would be able to purchase the united states government what they say what is to the wealthiest people in this country that said you guys already own much of the economy we are now gonna give you the opportunity to own the government and the result of that is the wealthiest people in this country are pouring huge amounts of money into campaigns in order to elect candidates whose sole function in life is to represent the rich and the powerful one family in america but second wealthiest families the koch brothers you got this family and what they wanted to cut social security they want to eliminate social security letter want to cut medicare eliminate medicare and medicaid and the environmental protection agency they dont want to simply not raise the minimum wage they want to do with the concept of the minimum wage so workers can work with bucks and ill this family is going to spend some million dollars in this election cycle in other words what democracy has become one vote they have one vote plus nine hundred billion dollars now when you how one family spending more money on a campaign the life of a democratic party or the republican party you are not talkin about democracy you are talking about and we got good stuff here is my second promise to you tonight and that is that no nominee of mind to the uss supreme court will get that position unless he or she is loud and clear telling the american people that they will vote to overturn citizens united by the way when we talk about democracy and we talked about the fact that brave men and women throughout our history have fought and died to defend democracy it is important to say a word about those republican governors and legislators who are trying to suppress the vote all over this country that ive been involved in a lot of election sometimes ive lost sometimes i have one but it is never occurred to me to figure out a way to deny the vote to people who disagree with me and would vote against me i regard it as an act of political cowardice colors for people to not have the guts to go out in a free and fair election the think the only way they can win islamic horrible lowincome people young people people of color to vote and my suggestion to those people if you are afraid of a fair election get another job anything to say about it and i will if elected president there will be one law fifty states in his country and that is if youre eighteen years of age you are registered dogs out when we talk about democracy let me tell you what i wanna see all want to see this country one of the highest voting turnout of any country not one of the lowest voter turnouts and i want to see anybody here tonight regardless of their political views if you wanna run for office i want you to be able to run for office without having to big campaign contributions from wealthy people and that is why i support public funding of elections and let me touch on another issue of enormous consequence we live as all of you know in a highly competitive global economy and if we are going to seek see now and in the future we need the best educated workforce in the world that means that means that with mom and dad go to work they know that their kids are in highquality prek programs that they can afford it public school teachers are adequately funded and this is what it also sees it in american weve got legislation it to do this every public college and university must be it is hopefully think about it for a second we have hundreds of thousands of bright young people in this country they are qualified theyre ready to go to college they cant go for one reason their families lack the money what we are doing is pulling out the latter form right underneath them give them the opportunity to make it into the middle class to become teachers or doctors or engineers or scientists that is unfair to those young people but it is unfair to the future of this country our job is the capture the best intellect so that we can to say to young people you cant get the education because your families lack the money is totally absurd totally absurd and what we are also gonna deal with is the absurd situation today of millions of young people and people not so young who are struggling with high levels of student debt now i spoke two years ago i spoke to young woman in burlington vermont her dream was to go to medical school become a primary care physician for lowincome people exactly what we need our penalty for doing what this country desperately needs was coming out of school it does all over this country there is a deadpool crisis we need deadliest we need to make sure that people can afford to go to get this that they could access to access that came out of school a debt all over this country people are graduating school deeply in debt that take twenty twentyfive percent of their incomes on student debt now what i dont understand when we talk about student that how does it happen that people are scott with student that interest rates of percent when you could refinance your home the for the site so our legislation will allow people to refinance at the lowest interest rates they could find it will get the government out of the business of profiteering lot of workingclass families now people so well so great idea burning but it is expensive their right it is expensive going to cost about billion a year you know were gonna pay for it attacks on wall street speculation when wall street collapsed in they came back the taxpayers of this country oh please bill of sale will be good boys well now its wall streets turn to bail out the middle class and when we talk about our responsibilities as human beings and his parents there is nothing more important than leaving our planet healthily and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren pope francis is rights debate is over the scientific community is virtually unanimous climate change is real it is close by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems throughout our country and much of the world we have a moral responsibility to lead the world to work with china and russia and india countries all over this world is transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel so energy efficiency and sustainable energy and when we talk about needs of the american people of where we want to go as a donation i hope that every person here knows that there is only one major wealthy nation on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right that is the united states of america that is going to change the affordable care act has done a lot of good i was proud to support it but we have got to go further million people still have no health insurance and many more are underinsured with high premiums and high deductibles in my view we have got to move toward a medicare for all singlepayer program health care is a right of all people not a privilege and when we talk about where we want to go as a nation we have got to understand the world we oppose a long way in overcoming discrimination and racism and prejudice sadly and tragically racism remains alive and well in america and i promise you my third promise there will be no president who will fight hard to end institutional racism in this country and reform a broken criminal justice system the first point maybe the most important point is that no president not bernie sanders anybody else can address the enormous problems that we face in this country and i touched on some of them so enormous problems no president can do you know why let me tell you what no other candidate with the powers that be in this country that is corporate america wall street corporate media the large campaign donors they are so powerful that no president of loan can effectively take them on and bring about the changes that we need in this country to add room lives working people the only way that real change takes place is when we make it political revolution in which millions of people in all black in white and latino and native american and asian american gays and straights then and women people who were born in this country people who were born in other countries now what politics in america is about touched on this is our opponents are trying to divide us they are trying to divide those who are born in this country from those who werent there trying to divide straight people from gay people men or women and i were antidote is to say that i know you not deployed we are going to stay together and we are gonna say yes your when your super pacs may have all the body but we have something you dont have and what we have a look around you can i we are the people and a simple political fact and this is just a fact of history is that when people stand together in demand change we never lose we never lose think about it for a moment think about it think about the civil rights struggle of millions of people coming together saying were gonna and racism in america think about women coming together and say were not going to be second class citizens and think about the environmental community coming together and see your address the environmental crises that we face think about the progress made in recent years led by the gay community in their straight allies when we stand together and we say you know were gonna create an economy that just just doesnt make the rich richer but its gonna give dignity and security to the elderly because we are not going to cut social security were going to expand social security now my message than i is please do not think small the big you are living now we could have if we were poor country we could have a we would have a very different type of discussion if youre a poor country that people would have to say its too bad we cant afford to send their kids to college we cant afford health care people brothers and sisters you were living today in the wealthiest country in the history of the world which very few people understand that because almost all of the well is going to the people on the top utopian thinking to say that when we think big and when we stand together we can create a situation where every man woman and child in this country has health care as a right not your clothes thinkin it existed every other major country it is not utopian thinking to say that we can have the best childcare and prek system in the world it is thought utopian thinking because many other countries already do it to say that caller public colleges and universities should be tuitionfree not utopia it is not utopia to say that the veterans the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend this should get their health care and the benefits that they are not utopia utopian to say that every person in this country no matter their race their religion their disability their sexual orientation should be able to realize the full promise of equality thatnot charged child i would country workers what people say the issue it is going globalbeautiful introductions and thank you charleston for their stern and let me tell you you are a proud taken a huge relief to the boys and what the point is is this campaign is about bringing people together because when we bring the middleclass and workingclass together when we bring white and black and hispanic native american men and women trading ok now you look for where we cant stop us from transforming the country the american people are beginning to catch on to whats going on in this country sick and tired of establishment politics tired of establishment economics and with the establishment media the people of this country on the stand one fundamental point and that his corporate greed in america that it is immoral that is unsustainable good almost all of the new wealth generated in this country is going to the top one percent and you were taught together i gotta change that understand that we have a corrupt political system went billion are able to buy politicians will joke and what we know what the candidate will say and that is we cannot bring about the kind of changes that we need in this country there is a political revolution and what clearly is that this great country of ours belongs to all of us not just a handful of billionaires but americans and the reason they dont understand the reason they dont feel it is that almost all well and all of that income is going to be a few together is to create an economy that works for working families not just the people on trial very very rich and everyone else that in any time since the nineteen twenties the issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time the great economic youre sure the great political together we are going when the top one tenth of one percent of percent almost as much well as the bottom there is something profoundly wrong when we have seen in recent years the proliferation of millionaires and billionaires while the average american fork slog around was for low wages and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country there is something profoundly wrong when one of the walton family owns well forty percent of the american people enough and its contrary this campaign and the people of america are sending a message and that message is simple you cannot continue you are not going to continue to get huge tax regs when children in america go hungry corporate america and the billion not gonna continue to send out jobs to china and other countries when millions here thats really good paying jobs are not going to put their billions in profit in the cayman islands to avoid paying their fair share of taxes we are saying loudly and clearly is corporate greed and we are going to end it income and wealth inequality not only impact every state in america my state of vermont let me tell you how it impacts in south carolina and the last two years if you can believe it ought wealthiest people in this country whattt not a lot of people there well increase by a hundred and fifty six billion dollars while the billion become much much richer percent of the children here in south carolina are living in poverty whats million children in america and its south carolina those children and poverty black allwhite this across the board and impacts every race and together we are ashamed of having the highest child poverty rate no country which is great turns its back on children no country proud country leaves kids childcare without these housing and when we talk about basic rights about the needs of everyone is human beings let us talk about health care that the united states is the only country to all people why i believe medicare program insurance companies and the drug companies and the big money interests like what their day is going to come uninsured population almost in half the number of from percent to percent a small box and south carolina health insurance and legislature of this as provided for in the affordable care act health care in this country last month i asked i asked them and kids who are high school graduates between the ages of and and what their unemployment and underemployment rates were this is what they found if the kids were white high school graduates percent of them were unemployed if they were more than any other country on her china is a country much much larger than china is a communist authoritarian country pretty tough stuff we have more people in jail and let me tell you if anybody believe that there is a direct connection between five and a half million people in this country who have no jobs and school if you think there is not a connection between that reality and the fact that so many people are in jail you would be sorely mistaken as president building more jails instead of locking more people and when we talk let me ask all of the men who are here tonight just stand with women and fight have been married for my republican colleagues of america unforgettable when your baby comes in the world and is a pretty big day for the baby as well and democracy in south carolina if that woman that family have decent incomes mom can stay home weeks and months and long and nourish the most important time box if moms family does not have sufficient you know what happens that baby is separated from because her mom has to go back to work in five days or ten days and that is why i will fight to make sure that every family in america gets three months of pay and we are also gonna of america being the only major country on earth does not provide pay guarantees will pay unemployment in america is all but percent of youth unemployment is thirty forty fifty percent it is clear to me that the united states government wants to be a major jobs program to put our people back to work south carolina state of vermont all over america our infrastructure our roads our bridges our rail system water plants wastewater infrastructure is crumbling i have proposed a trillion dollar investment let us rebuild our infrastructure put when we talk about jobs create millions of jobs we must the loss of millions of jobs to trade policies trade policies so how has all of america you are looking at the united states congressman who voted against not permanent normal trade position corporate america wants to buy their products wants us to purchase products airtight im not a child what is the most important is impossible to one issue that impacts every five years ago as most of you know by a fivetofour decision the supreme court of the united states poorly with the citizens united case and what they said people in america you already own much of america the economy opportunity to purchase the united states and that heres what they are trying to do right now american political system today as a result of citizens united has been totally corrupted and the foundations of american democracy are being american democracy is not supposed to be about buying elections and buying american democracy is supposed to be one person one vote many campaign promises to you right now and that is any of mine to the united states supreme court will make it loud and clear that he or she will vote to overturn in the world democracy and when we talk about one person fifty years ago congress passed the president johnsons full voting rights act and what the voting rights act finally heres that every american has the right to vote regardless of the color of his or her skin got one of the most important provisions of the voting rights out and literally supreme court based its decision republican governors and attorney generals and legislators began to go to work to figure out how they could deny poor people and people of color and old people the right to vote you know i have been involved in many campaigns in my state of vermont ave los many are curved jimmy never once tried to figure out a way to deny my opponents i believe win elections based on the strength of your ideas not by keeping i have been introduced which will go a long way to make one very simple point and america if you are a team you registered to vote people who have do not have the guts to campaign on their ideas people who think the only way they can win not to vote these people political cowards they should get another job that in america today we are living in a very highly competitive global economy and of our economy is the succeed in the future we need the best in the world are you human tragedy that today hundreds of thousands of bright young people kids well done well in school kids who are qualified to get a higher education on not able to go to college for one reason and one reason alone and that is their families lack the money that is not what america it is unfair to those young people who want to become doctors they want a rise out of poverty to make it into the middle class and were pullin but it is even if we talk about the future of america well we need all of the bright people we can make our economy strong growth i have introduced legislation and well make it happen if elected president to make every college and university in america through which three financial today like my family their parents never went to college they dont know anybody who went to college the idea of going to college is beyond their wildest i want those kids to know that if they do their homework if they take school seriously they will be able to go to college regardless levels of school and heres the crazy there are people with food and debt paying interest rates of percent when you can refinance your home three or four percent people to refinance at lower interest rates of profiteering profit from workingclass families who simply wanted to send the college when we talk about our responsibilities as human beings as parents as adults there is nothing more than i can then making certain that we leave this planet to our children and grandchildren in a way that is habitable scientific community is virtually unanimous climate change is real climate change is caused by human activity and climate change is already causing problems in our country and around the world years we have a small window of opportunity basically a few use to get our act together to transform our energy system or else by the end of this century the planet earth will be five to degrees warmer more trials drought flood were extreme weather disturbances more acidification of the ocean more rising sea levels and the cia tells us more conflict around the world as people fight over a limited natural resources we have a moral responsibility to work with china and russia and india to lead the world and moving away from fossil fuel energy efficiency and sustainable ranking member leader of the opposition on the democratic side on the budget committee about national priorities and about values i want you to know that a number of months ago the republicans passed a budget in the congress they control the house and the senate and this is what their budget and i want everybody including working class people who vote republican to know what was what was in that budget is repeal of the affordable care act massive cuts in medicaid the result million more americans lose health insurance republicans what happens when how many of them how many of them trying to put food on the table they found but im billion dollars in tax breaks to one person was a greedy multimillion workingclass and middleclass republican support our job this campaign may be the most important thing we can do is to get people in america working people middle class people lowincome people voting wanna make cuts veterans programs are we not gonna also that when men and women country we are not gonna cut veterans benefits and when we talk about our country what kind of country we know that it can be we must be very clear that we are going to end institutional racism and we are going to transform and we all going to trans and make radical changes in a criminal justice system that is broken the good news in terms of combating racism over the last many many decades not far enough but if we were sitting here thirty years ago and somebody said well you know i think in people of the united states overcame hundreds of years of racism and we will be collecting an africanamerican is president of the united states nobody would have believed that but in fact the american people look beyond the color of a candidates can look at his ideas and voted for obama of american society no one can deny i am not just talking about the sixth of a man walking to class a where people take out a gun and kill nine people that is literally impossible to comprehend and im not just talking about the hundreds of hate groups that exists only function they are only function of africanamericans immigrants or gays or juice can you imagine a group whose only functional but in addition to clear them talking about racism we are talking about sound for bland michael brown about eric gone are we talking about walter scott pretty grey and many are we do not know died unnecessarily and wrongly at the hands of police offices or in police custody must change nobody will raise our broken things to be done in order to the community people trust a whole lot of police officers in my community and if anybody hear things today is an easy job youre wrong and the vast majority of police offices tried to do the best they can honestly and protecting the people but by the way many of these police officers are underpaid they have crazy schedules and live under enormous stress what police official breaks that police officer must be held accountable new rules regarding the use of force to break up crowds to prevent violence and what good police officers do that with us and lethal force should be the last thing americans are in jail for non violent crimes we need to rethink the war on drugs i really remarkable young persons criminal record but the crux on wall street who destroyed our economy lot of people around the country have been talking about and i agree with and when congress reconvenes in september introduced legislation and that is to end the absurdity of private corporations making profits by running jails and building people further addiction drug addiction are illnesses that need to be treated drug courts and medical and mental health intervention are providing and they serve time and they got out of jail and they have no education they have no jobs no money no housing associate with exactly the same people that got him in jail and all end up back in jail point of view and it makes no sense from a financial point of view it costs more money to put people in jail to the university of south carolina all of you are aware that we live in a nation in which a handful of very very wealthy people have extraordinary power over our economy and our political life and thats the reality they are very very powerful and many of them are extremely greedy i will never understand how families like the koch brothers work a deal worth billion dollars apparently think they need more and more and theyre willing to the children the elderly the sick and the poor in order to become even richer i will never understand that kind of green yes yes but there is something that they

guy is so incredible right here the police department has been so incredible so nick i want to thank you we went over the other day we met people who are in seriously good condition nobody gonna mess with your police department is that right so nick thank you and thank the department i appreciate it a couple of weeks ago a certain politician nice politician nikki haley said in a speech a rebuttal speech that referring to me although my name wasnt mentioned and then ultimately it was confirmed that im angry that im very angry and that the people that are with me are very angry and the people that are with be a really with me those arent the people that are and they can flip fact one of the things thats come out and all of the studies is that the people that are with donald trump this seriously with us like theyre not gone anywhere theyre not going anywhere well as other guys i think including the two categories were at nobodys changing whereas other guys are at eighteen percent of the worlds oil change if the wind changes my people sick with us and who is made and the statement was made that were angry people where the cover of time when the cover of all these magazines and i said were not angry people we dont want to be angry but i said right now i will agree me personally and a lot of the people that are with me we are angry because were angry at and competence were angry at the iran deal where we give away a hundred and fifty billion dollars and get nothing were angry and i trade deals which china is making so much money that weve rebuilt their country and in the meantime our country and the infrastructure of our country is going to hell were angry what we make a charge in bergdahl deal whose it dirty rotten trader where six people were killed looking forum and trying to bring him back till six young great people kill looking for sergeant bergdahl and we make a swap knowing that he was a traitor they had a colonel and a general talking to these people and talking to the people that worked with them they knew he was a traitor they knew it and we make a deal sergeant we get and they get five of the worst killers that theyve covered it theyve cut it for the last nine years ok were tired of deals like this were tired of obamacare which we will repeal and replace healthcares going up per cent in the last year and a half its going to die in seventeen anyway it has two unless the republicans work out another deal like the budget deal the deal they worked out three weeks ago is a disgrace so obamacare were repealing were replacing but were angry and i said yeah im angry now when they asked it was on the debate the previous debate because i skipped the last one before the one the other night and i raised six million dollars for the veterans right and somebody said do you regret skipping the debate and i said no not at all as they show what do you mean you might have won iowa i said i did win iowa but i said i dont regret it because we raise so much money for the vets and we wouldnt have really been able to do that at another time though is just a point in time it was a point in time but you have to be treated properly by the networks last night i understand for the last debate i heard somebody read to me that they had the highest rating for a debate a republican primary debate in years and they think its much longer than that they had a great trading well where they have had about wasnt in the debate when do you think i dont know watching watching bush and watch in this one and that one i think they would have done so well who knows i hope they do i want everybody to do and we have some good people we have some really good people but they had this phenomenal rating abc justannounced it next time theyre going to get the opening a little bit better you know what im talking and by the way in all fairness to ben carson you could not hear a thing is people wondering why has been standing there while we were all saying that you couldnt hear a thing so it was nobodys fault it was actually a production mishap and it makes for more exciting right is the more exciting right so we are people that are not gonna be angry for long because if i get elected president all of the things that you cant stand looking at that you cant believe its happening to our country all of these horrible deals at uc being made many of them being made because everybody on the stage with me and on the other side theyre taken care of by special inches they have a lobbyist this special interest in getting tremendous amounts of money you will be angry when youll be happy you got to be very happy can be very very happy and it wont take a long time it wont take a long time you know recently i just as for tickets i wanted tickets for the debate gets star power and if i could i had a lot of power we get twenty tickets everybody gets like tickets so we called the rnc corey called the rnc we want tickets well we can whos got him all of the donors have the donors the donors you know the donors i said thats no good i dont have any donors because im selffunding i dont have the owners saw the daughters dont mean donors the donors thats a nice word donor but its not donors its special interest lobbyists all these people that have total control over the candidates they had all the tickets now i must tell you time magazine did a poll and the poll who won the debate and i won the debate with a cent of the vote number percent of the vote i had seventy believe me i have no power over time magazine but i had seventy percent of the vote number two had six percent and then it went down from there so we do i say i cant get any tickets and then i announced during the debate because i did these people make hes really lame statements and you hear the place erupted in applause and see whats going on over here but i understood i understand and i announced on television the reason the audience clapping for certain people up here is because their donors and special interests and lobbyists and have total control over the people and they dont like these because im and i know many of them actually they do like to be im even friends but if they ask you to do something about president im saying bye bye im working for these people out here so i think came up the other day and a friend of michaels visit dr great doctor and he said you know donald that the united states which is the largest purchaser of drugs in the world massive massive amounts for medicare which was for social security for everything from muslim medicare so we gonna save social security too by the way were going to seriously i mean youve been paying in four years and now they want such a big way they want to chop away at social security by the way like they want to chop away at the second amendment which is not going to happen ok like i honestly like theyre doing with religion like theyre chopping away at christianity and believe me they are doing that and this may or may not be a somewhat religious audience but i will tell you one thing very soon were going to start saying merry christmas again when his christmas symbols for sure my friend calls me up a great doctor he says you know youre running and you doing great im so proud of you i love to hear it i said again and he said but you know with the medical and with the drugs the united states the largest purchase early they dont negotiate price its almost as if you want to go and you want to buy drugs drugs to make you feel better right drugs to make you feel better you want to buy drugs you have to get drugs you go to the drug see you buy it off the counter the united states is paying like a price like that i said you have to be kidding he said i dont know why i said i do i do because the drug companies have an unbelievable lobby and these guys that run for office that are on my left and right and plenty of others theyre all taken care of by the drug companies and then im gonna put out competitive bidding so i said to myself wow let me just some numbers if we competitively bid drugs in the united states we could say as much as a year thank you thank you thank you thank you thats one element and the reason i mean you take a look at a friend of mine and we dont have that much television there just about people back so i wont insult him and he happens to be a very good guy what did johnson right what did johnson of johnson and johnson hes jeb bushs campaign finance manager hes running bushs campaign now you tell me you tell me well listen to this number one hes in favor of common core number to his week on push like scott he loves common core hes the only one that i know that likes it but thats ok we gonna bring education back locally no more common core no more coming just a week on immigration and thats not gonna remember they come as an act of love remember that home education is very interesting because were number thirty in the world you have norway sweden denmark china and plenty of others that you have thirdworld countries and number thirty is the united states so with thirty in the world in education and were number one per pupil and caused by phone number two is even close so thats the way it is gonna happen that way anymore phones not going to happen that way now with savings so the drug companies they have tremendous power if theyre talking about three hundred billion dollars i mean thats a lot of money billion and then you wonder why does a lot of people say how can people be so stupid things they know its wrong but their politicians all talk no action theyre good at one thing getting reelected have some good politicians but you have mostly people that think about how do i get reelected ok how do i get reelected so im the only one im self funding so when these guys see me who i know many of the guys im looking at the room im standing at the debate im watching marco sweating like a dog on my right im watching ted cruz no i would never say that about donald but he said something bad in the esm would you say it again he said no and i like that he didnt do that we would have ended up in a big fight but it was nice and he didnt honestly to have him here i have not go honestly marco was having a hard time and hes a nice guy hes a nice guy i mean again and again and again after three times you have a very good memory and have to three times i said when he said that about three minutes ago then i said wait wait wait he said that two minutes ago the same exact thing so after the fifth time i said what the hell is going on over here but we need really smart really tough really fair people with great heart that want to take care of your health care want to take care of people they cant afford health care you know its very interesting were gonna bring down the price of health going to bring it down big big big big league because president obama live twenty eight times he said you keep your doctor said you keep your plan times i kept saying why doesnt somebody gets sued for fraud when you do the times and even democrats went because of what he said and they wish they werent in that position so he lied but you know what a lot of people give me hit because they say were gonna take it as a group is a small group relatively of people in the bottom that theyre not going to be able to be taken care of and i say we have to as republicans we have to take you just want to take care of him i said were not gonna have people dying on the streets were going to get him into a hospital take care of them were getting kids were not gonna have people dying in shapes and i say that and i said and all the time i get a poison then they say all he wants to do this you want to do that thats not the public the republican way is people can take care of themselves we have to help when im gonna let him die and i say it all the time when not yet ill let him die on the sidewalk were not going to let him die industry and its not even a lot of money we have hospitals doing no business we gotta get them fixed up but were gonna save tremendously on health care its going to be private were going to take the lines at a play were gonna have so many different options its going to be so much better than to be less expensive you looked at your deductibles not only are your rates going up but you look at deductibles right now unless you get hit by a tractor youll never ever be able to use your health care and look at washington they dont even want the obama get it on have to happen i wonder why they dont have to have it so were going to take care of it folks and were gonna have so many great things by the way were going to competitive bidding and ill tell you what were gonna save so much money and those drug companies are gonna hate me so much i could i know i was going to say some at the debate and im looking at the audience was supposed to be childrens college kids and young kids and it wasnt because these rich guys bought all the tickets from the college susans i dont actually totally believe that i actually think that the rnc gave him the tickets to be totally honest i think they actually got the tickets not to buy but a lot of them did buy tickets so i look outside a saying wow thats a lot of people out there i know half these people i know the obvious i know most of the special interests and im looking at that audience and im saying this is bad stuff but i had the most beautiful applause from diane and eric and melania in the front row thats about it even though i want but i but i understood so you have to understand whats going on a lot of times you think that the politicians are doing horrible horrible deals and they are but you think that theyre really really not smart people they are actually smart people but theyre working for themselves theyre doing what they lobbyists who puts up millions and millions and millions of dollars every time they run im just talking about the honest up this is all honesty this other stuff that goes on that you know you have to proof right i mean you look at some of hillarys speeches when she gets a fortune and shes you know give me a break take a look at that nobody right now nobody looks at that bill makes us feel each gets a tremendous amount of money pharmor there and then all of a sudden miracles happen right miracles happen and i imagine somebody is looking at that and by the way a recent poll just came out that i am beating hillarys so badly and the general election just like we do people say how you gonna straighten out the budget its a mess just like we do with what i just told you about medication and buying medicines and all of this same thing happens with the military within a building no church so strong but were buying equipment and were buying things that are generals dont even want were buying things that they dont want what bike lanes instead of another one because that company has been a lobbyist and a stronger were gonna get them the equipment they want to save a lot of money and whether to build ourselves so strong nobody im telling you nobody is gonna play with us we dont want to use it nobody is gonna play with us we have we have situations right now where we have the migration and were accepting people and were accepting them in by the thousands and you look at new hampshire you look at this area with the problems you have the problems you have with the drugs were allowing people to come into this country that we have absolutely no idea who they are where they come from are they isis maybe maybe not somebody said at least of them are all really if we had look at what those two people did two months ago radicalized people they killed people to people young people they killed and plenty of people right now living in the hospital gravely wounded look at paris one hundred and thirty people killed now the strongest gun laws anywhere in the world his friends and paris people dont have guns except for the bad guys so they walked in they start shooting they say you get over here you get off that killed a hundred and thirty people theres a tremendous number of people right now in the hospitals if guns were on the other side of that equation with the bullets could find a different direction you want to have that kind of conduct you wonder how so we are going to protect our nd amendment nobodys gonna play with us nobody saw this all started when i came down and i made the statement to the press and i talked about illegal immigration and i get it yet i guess that was like two for weeks it was brutal then all of a sudden people started maybe hes got a point maybe hes got a point then for five weeks later people are some really strong i think trumps right there is a lot of illegal immigration and causing a lot of economic on what is causing this a lot of trouble from a criminals standpoint right now as we speak it was released last week we have a hundred and seventy nine thousand illegal tramadol immigrants illegal criminal these are people that have been convicted of crimes some very big that means we have a hundred and seventy nine thousand people here that have committed crimes that shouldnt big runs that shouldnt be in the country thats bigger a hundred and seventy nine thousand people is bigger than any city by a lot in new hampshire thats a massive amount of people thats a massive amount so whether just something thats going to be whether you like dwight eisenhower no matter what you do white eisenhower i like ike everybody said nice guy we either have a country folks are we dont remember this we either have a country we do so within a half to take people with it to get rid of those hundred and seventynine and i dont wanna put him in our jails i dont wanna put him in our jails are jails across augusta fortune were bringing them back where they came from and were gonna be respected by those countries which were not respected at all by those countries were breaking up back where they came from and let that country put him in prison for the next years is when idling and then never ever coming back to our country again their guy never now but all of a sudden we started seeing people are focused on it i will say this if i didnt bring up the subject of illegal immigration at my opening when i announced i was running for president you would not have anybody even talking about it the other night on this stage i wont mention whos somebody said yes and im very strong on illegal immigration we will build a wall said it very lonely will you afraid that somebody has a lot and i go now all of a sudden i know i have two out of the group they said the other night and other ones on television said yes we have strong waters we will build a wall and my wife came up to me she said darling did you hear that thats the first time ive ever heard that said by anybody else but you we have to build a wall walls work just ask israel walls work they work i dont mean the little walls of the little wall i mean those who else you know i mean serious roles i mean trump all they work they were and they work if theyre right you know in time magazine and a couple of magazines i read ive been on the cover of time magazine so much lately when i was on last week i didnt even know they were putting them in the cover can you imagine thats when you really hitting it big when youre on the cover of time magazine you dont even know you got to be on the cover thats what they had like this ramp they had a wall like this and then a ramp built over the wall and then another ramp and they have trucks going over the ramp and they loaded up with drugs and trucks going right over there i dont even know why they didnt just rip down the wallets a little would have been cheaper and whatever africas up it goes down they sell their drugs in the united states lot of them come over to here to head to new hampshire and they get back on the go back they build ramps over the walls and ill tell you something i met the border patrol people theyre phenomenal the reason i met them is they called me and they said wed love to meet you and i went to laredo texas and it was incredible these people are incredible they can do the job they had told to stand back did poll dont touch anybody there told let people come in they dont want them these are incredible men and women and their standing there people walking right in front beautiful equipment everything looks good everything except the one thing they are told dont do anything and when they do something thats a given the fine let him go they can go wherever they want that cnn that you never see him again we either have a country away dont want it to be so strong and just let me ask you one question about the wall who the hell is going to pay for the wall what you know the head of mexico today said theres no way were paying for the wall please inform mr trump i said i said the walls gonna just get bigger when has that attitude now the politicians come up with something they used to come up and say this is no way honestly that you can be able to build a wall is easy i build nests of buildings its much tougher they said you cant really do that can yes absolutely now just so you understand fifteen years ago they want to build a wall you know why they didnt build it they couldnt get an environmental impact statement approved its true they couldnt because there was snakes toads road all sorts of crap right in the way they couldnt can you believe it we can build a wall and you have china in the south china sea ripping the hell out of the ocean and building military bases in the middle of the south china sea and we kid do you think by the way that china got an environmental impact statement i dont you know they said they said were gonna build it they started work the following morning thats what happens we are so left behind and we worry about the carbon footprint and i say you know i see obama saying the single greatest problems this country has its global warming ok i tell you what i just got out so we had a blizzard outside theres no warming is his brutal somebody from new hampshire said this is one of the worst winters you know what hes talking about global warming then he gets on a very old with the old engines at spew a lot of stuff and he takes his wife and his two really beautiful daughters and he goes in the seven fortyseven dalai to play golf and that he comes back and then he has a speech on saw folks have a whole different thinking ive been saying for a long period of time take the oil remember remember this about me i was against because ive had hillary say i dont like donald trump stone and ive heard jeb say it till i dont like donald trumps tone energy guy so he doesnt like my time but but honestly said and they said that the same day and i thought to myself i can tone it down im smart guy i turn on television did shopping peoples heads off in the middle ease if you question the head comes off if youre not christian the head comes up we havent seen stuff like this since medieval times alright medieval times and people are worried about my tone you are at the other night at the base they ask ted cruz serious question but what do you think of waterboarding is it ok and i honestly i thought hed say absolutely in egypt and he said well its concerned about the answer because something she just said a terrible thing you know she said shouted out ok youre not allowed to say and i never expect to hear that from you again she said i never expect to hear that from you again she said hes a pussy thats thats now here so you remember when not so long ago not so far from here i had a group of people were doing questionandanswer and somebody came up with a pretty tough saving about obama and the press got very angry cuz i didnt offend the president remember took a lot of heat and i didnt reprimand the person that said it so i want to just tell you right now maam he reprimanded ok chiste chiste he reprimanded for the press this is a serious reprimands to so the president so we have lined up to make some of the great trade deals and to take our documents that are so bad we have lined up the finest business people in the world rolanda by the way they call me i dont even call them these are great great people summer nice some horrible human beings summer people that you dont want to have dinner with but theyre great at what they do i know the greatest negotiators in the world we need them thats how we got into the hole with these deals and im telling you about and believe me other other facets of the same thing its the same exact thing were going to save so much money i was hearing the other day they were talking about the budget and a political person said its his idea and it has gone to have the budget balanced within years twentyfive years idea was that he thought he was doing a good job visa politicians folks that never gonna do it and whether to do a great were gonna have a better country would have better services we can have better roads and airports and hospitals and were gonna pay less for was gonna pay less you know im building a big building right now on pennsylvania avenue that i got from the federal government obama can you believe it how good is that if i go work done i mean what a job he did i we had the old post office in washington d c right we are now we just announced were gonna make it a worldclass one of the great hotels of the world an incredible building and we just announced with two years ahead of schedule were going to have it open in september of this year two years ahead of schedule and under budget ahead of schedule when theyve been nice if our country on its projects instead of having a percent cost overrun boy can you imagine how much as people make when you

many things happen jim neal great jim hill in los angeles a phenomenal female wonderful woman a vet years old who was killed by an illegal immigrant raped sodomized killed we have problems and we have to solve our problems and some people say youre very divisive you very divisive what they want me to be politically correct they dont want to talk about the problems they dont want to talk about and i do talk about him and a lot of people are now coming up to me and saying youre right youre so right i brought up a problem radical islamic terrorism abroad people went crazy how could you say we have a problem this is a worldwide problem and when i brought it up people said its not politically correct dont do it advisers people right back there they said dont do it but you know what people respect that i did it and friends of mine who are muslim called me up at this shit done thank you its a problem is gotta be discussed we have a president that wont discuss the subject he wont talk about it and youre not going to solve the problem if you dont want to admit what the problem is so it began and i started with the butchers and you know sheriff joe from arizona hes like a great time he enjoys me last week and he enjoys every day hes a tough guy at the border thats one thing and he said trump is the toughest at the border but i dont want to just be tough we want to be smart we want people to come into our country but they have to come into our country legally drive legally they go through a process as they come in and weve gotta take great people we want great people to come and we dont want people pouring across the border like now i got to know i was in laredo texas and i got to know i was invited by our tremendous people that work the border the border patrol people these are tremendous people these are people that wanna do their job they called me because theyre not allowed to do this is standing there great theyre wonderful to have wonderful equipment everythings fine and theyre told stand back and people walk right through well i y and you know its mistake its very unfair to people that do legally go through the brush is you have people that way for years to get in and theyre going up a list and theyve worked and theyve studied probably and friends has probably the toughest gun laws in the world are no dents accepted the bad guys and this sleaze bag with the press would always say remember the name right the press would say great things like hes rappin hun the press was say wonderful things were looking for him they called the mastermind mastermind whats the mister money put a few people in this study cheating people theres nothing whats the mastermind i call them the guy with the dirty hat low i q a terrible guy now they got him they gotta but the press is building them up and then they wonder why our youth is being radicalized add isis and others are using our internet we invented the internet isis is using it to radicalize our kids and our kids are leaving and coming back one thing with me if they leave and they leave to fight for isis then i coming back i dont care so were going to strengthen our border were gonna have a really strong border were going to build a wall of windows bank for the wall mexico now that i have a great relationship with mexico i have a great relationship with the mexican people with hispanics in nevada leading in the polls with hispanics im gonna do great with this fetish is under bring jobs back from china and all sorts of countries that have taken our jobs they have stripped us of a job like where babies like taking candy from a baby they have stripped does of our jobs you know interestingly new hampshire you have been a big victim and in this case it wasnt so much china you look at nafta you look at some of the things that happened to hear i look at these factories that are empty i look at plans that in a senior citizen housing and thats wonderful senior citizen has it but somebody has to have the job you need the job spec our country has lost millions and millions of jobs to other countries and now were losing companies to look at corporate inversions you look at whats happening corporate inversions its wonderful senior citizen housing but somebody has to have the job unbelievable schiesser are canadians lost millions and millions of jobs to other countries and now were losing companies you look at corporate inversions you look at whats happening corporate inversions its unbelievable pfizer great company theyre very good with taking care of politicians a great company they get what they want remember this the drug companies have tremendous power whether its tyler johnson and johnson the interesting things pfizers leaving with all their power and theyre leaving thousands and thousands of great jobs behind because the taxes are too high and because they cant get their money back into the country this trillions of dollars outside of the united states right now i talked to these politicians and im against didnt even know what the hell im talking about they dont know about corporate intrusion then even know what it is but what happens is companies are now leaving our country because the taxes are so ridiculous with the highest tax country in the world ok and they leaving and great companies pfizer great company others just announced a leaving and they can leave you cant stop you can try and get him to stop theyll find ways you know these great lawyers great wall street lawyers believe me youll find ways around it they leaving and theyre leaving jobs behind mind and tremendous you talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs behind and its happening more and more you know its an interesting thing we have a president they cant get anybody to do anything so he signed you know executive orders and country wasnt supposed to be that way but he signs executive orders because he cant get he doesnt get people into the oval office into offices into something and do something right but make great deals make deals that everybodys happy with the way the country was supposed to work he doesnt do that he doesnt do that so heres the deal where our corporations and corporations within this country have two and a half trillion dollars outside of the country they want to bring it back i happen to think the number could be five trillion dollars its a massive amount of money if its brought back into the country its going to create work its gonna create jobs right now now heres the problem the democrats agree the republicans agree the liberals agree that conservatives agree everybody wants the money brought back they cant make a deal the reason they cant make it deals with have a leader well it needs the room one hour with the leaders i get it done how i guess so the inversion is that now corporations say that tired theyve been waiting for years and billions and billions of dollars outside of the country they cant bring it back so they are actually going out to get the money you believe this and everybody in washington agrees that we should allow him to bring in fact it would be so thats one of these you you know its one thing when you have the republicans and the democrats and they just agree on lots of different things and you can understand ill get him to agree youre right ill get it but they disagree on a lot of things and you can understand but thats the thing inversion thats the thing they can and they cant get it done shelf washington is gridlocked nothing happens and nothing good is going to happen if you folks vote in more these politicians these politicians dont have it their all talk and no action i dont give a damn if it doesnt work for me i have this great company but this incredible company ill go back ill be hit in the face with a beautiful salt water wave and one of my resume its ok its ok but you know what i want to do this a lot of people have said why do you do this why i do it because i want to make america great again its so much more even mike is a great kids he wanted you know don erik and i have great executives and and frankly you know somebody should what you built a really great company and i did you take a look at you know when i did the filing everyone said well who never run then i read hell never sign for me thats when you signed your life away as they said i think is gonna run that does it but youll never put into the net chose because maybe hes not as richer successful as people think i am i financials they thought that maybe a test for extensions cause youre allowed day extensions forever for the rest of your life you never have to put in it you could have so many extensions i told my account severe extraterrestrial out of money to do almost a hundred pages the biggest one ever filed by a factor of many times right i told my counsel i wanted done before days you get days to put him in but then you can have the extensions to the rescue life ok and some of these politicians they filed one page and theyve asked for extensions ok so i said i want to do it before the days because a lot of the pundits it well maybe less for extensions and itll go on past selection so i put them in and they went down and they looked and the company is a massive i built a great company very low debt tremendous cash flow and believe me if those numbers werent good i wouldnt be running right now because i wouldnt and thats why a lot of people said a private person they dont know what the hell i have nobody knows what they have but i filed this document done by the best accounting firms in washington the best law firms in washington everything right down to the way its supposed to be and you know what happened to press went down they were dying to see this and they couldnt believe it was much bigger than anybody ever anticipated the greatest assets or everything great low debt tremendous schedule so here is what happens i found it and i filed by probably would have even if i wasnt going to run every once in awhile you like to brag a little bit i will tell you but what happened is i filed at and im not saying it in a braggadocio sleigh its the kind of thinking that our country needs we have to make great deals now we cant continue to go on like this we cant lose five hundred and five billion dollars a year to china on trade deficit you cant do it you cant do it we cant lose hundreds of billions of dollars to japan they send our cars these cars are pouring in i went to los angeles recently i saw a ships the biggest ships have ever seen a loaded up with cars from japan we give them practically nothing its called imbalance its all one way we have people negotiating for us who are political hacks theyre the best political hacks in the world they get their jobs because they give campaign contributions some of them get the job because they work hard with politicians but they dont know anything carl icahn as an example is a great businessman he endorse me many businessmen of interest me they want to endorse me because they say cars and trucks the only one that knows what theyre talking about the politicians dont mention corporate intrusion before then even know what that term means companies are leaving us and we dont do anything about it and new hampshire knows it better than anybody as youve already gone through it but you have a hate to tell you have more companies leaving were gonna bring the companys back from china were gonna bring the companys back from japan were gonna bring the companys back from excuse me mexico mexico mexico is killing us at the border and theyre killing us with dread mexico just got the big nabisco plant from chicago its closing in chicago its moving to mexico so what are we not going to eat any more oreos thats a good thing not a bad thing mexico has many car plans coming people like going to become the car capital of the world a two and a half billion dollar plan in to see they were all set to build a new plant all set and it was all set to go and then the foreign company that was gonna build an announcer not going to go there they gonna go to mexico its crazy what were allowing to happen all because our leaders are incompetent ok theyre incompetent you know we make deals i always say so we get a trader six people killed looking six people go out and they look for them and they were killed young beautiful people are soldiers young beautiful people six of them killed go out look for sergeant bergdahl so we get bergdahl and by the way we know he was a traitor before we made the deal because we had a general and a colonel goin interview all of the people that he worked with and they told him what happened so we know its not even like oh gee we found out later that i can understand i would like it but that i can understand a little bit this is a case where weekend bergdahl and they get five pillars that theyve coveted that theyve wanted for years and theyre taking fight and there right now back to the battlefield looking to kill everybody including us ok this is what we get this is the way we make deals and cant go on go on go on i think im gonna do great in new hampshire i hope im going to do great i love the people thank you i love you too so we have so many things happening and we dont have the right people the migration migration its so sad to see and it is i have a heart you know people dont realize i am much warmer than other people and much warmer i want to help people i really do i want to help people i want to get rid of obamacare get you something i wanna and yeah but you know what we have some people that wont be able to live and we have to help people though we had to help when republicans donald trump proposed helping people that have made what we had to let him dying to see we cant do it and republicans understand that but we can have great plans theyre going to be less expensive gonna be much more i mean obamacare is out of control and how about your deductibles you have to be dead before you can use them so high that unless you have a fourteen years slow disease youre not going to be able to use it a man told me today from new hampshire just today he said he gave it up because he couldnt afford to get no coverage whatsoever hes always had coverage a lot of people had coverage if they were very happy with it given it up and now they have lousy coverage all the lines times about the doctor right times i actually said why did we sued for fraud because it was tried and by the way a lot of the democrats had they known to say when approved it it just made it but they will like to also it would have never been approved but your gonna keep your doctor all the things that he said were total eyes and if he did say that cuz they were good phrases they were false but they will get raises if he didnt say that they would have never gotten it fast and believe me obamacare is a big people sort of forgotten but i find it to be almost tougher sometimes the biggest applause i get when i say im going to terminate determining whether to terminate and replace it with something great less expensive and much better and people really want that a lot of people forget about the five billion dollar website for a website shit or crooked politics you listen to this song medicare going to keep your social security were gonna bring jobs back were gonna make a country rich again to keep it if youve been paying into social security for years and now they say we want to we want to raise the age we want to do all sorts of things were gonna bring jobs back theyve stripped our country of well you know we had a quarter last quarter when we had a century nogrowth so we have more people we have more trouble we have far more unemployment although it is reported that way look these unemployment statistics are meant and were devised by politicians so that it looks good when they say this room wouldnt be packed it was really i go to the other day i mean i go to dallas we have twentyone thousand people i go to mobile alabama of people by the way we get and i say we check out the cover of time magazine last week the most incredible story about us all of us that means but im like the messenger i feel like the messages on msn messenger but im gonna be a im gonna be a good youre going to love the messenger you gotta love you president youd be so proud in your country throughout the country again you know within a country we have to we can go on this way but i go to mobile alabama people theyre incredible people they like you is that different i mean youre from new hampshire there from mobile if they love the country you left the country we all left the country were all doing it for the same reason were losing our country and itll never be the same and we have a hilary is silly she makes it past her scandal which is really a big question you have a situation where general petraeus and many other people for doing five percent of what hillary clinton did have been destroyed and i think i helped him because ive been really pounding on top of everything else they wanted to take away his rank they wanted to reduce his rank and i said leave general petraeus alone its enough its enough these tough guys in washington you know their real tough guys they cant be dices they cant beat anybody afghanistan is going to hell the middle east is is going down ive been saying bomb the oil for years and they havent done it they just started after powers and theyre doing a very gentle bombing because they dont want to pollute the atmosphere and a not say what that true they dont want to bomb the oil because they dont want to pollute the atmosphere and yet obama will take air force one and all of boeing with the old engines and spew crap into the atmosphere as he goes to hawaii and saved for almost three weeks playing golf and then comes back in the same plane and then hell have a news conference on global warming and talking about the carbon footprint give me a break today i chose somebody to love god and add some of the greatest golf courses in the world and a rally on some of the great one at turnberry in scotland will have the british open some of the greatest british opens in the history of of golf and some of the great jack nicklaus against tom watson they say the duel in the sun right to duel in the sun the greatest tournament ever played was at turnberry the duel in the sun jack nicklaus tom watch it so i have to clean and stuff but you know what i let go but if i were in the white house i dont think id ever see turned very good i dont think i have a seat doral again i went to rally in miami i dont think ive ever seen any of the places that i have i dont think its anything i just want to stay in the white house in work my ass off but great just gonna leave you know you know now i hope im gonna be through the white house but im building a building right down the road thats also on pennsylvania you talk about deal making i brought it up today for the first time so the old puzzle has built in the old post office is incredible its on friday as a whole blocks on pennsylvania avenue best location right between the capitol building and though it has everybody wanted hi it very close contributors to obama every everybody sheridan helton everybody wanted one of the hottest its run by the gsa general services there the landlord for the united states and by the way very very good people and very very good professionals well thats because they chose me but they are honest they didnt use the i dont think id be saying that probably but the truth is i have i mean they are very good theyre excellent so what happened is and i work with ivanka has anyone heard of you and shes dressed and we put it in and a plan was to build a great take this whole post office which is no longer used and has been sitting for years and years like years really and take it and converted into one of the worlds great hotels and other people many hotel companies bid it was the hottest from what i hear lets say because theres so many people back there if there was one hundred but i doubt it just about the hottest property in the history of the general services administration they did it out and we came up with a great plan for a great hotels of the world and by the way i have to tell you this its two years ahead of schedule its opening listen to this itll open in september of this year isnt that convenient i said we have to open it before the big day so were gonna be opening in september of this year were actually i mean the limit was to use but were actually been a year and a half ahead of schedule which it on here when was the last time you heard about a government project what we love the tunnel in boston deli folks now is twenty years later in about million dollars over budget so heres just under budget and ahead of schedule by a lot is that nice wouldnt it be nice but i think in terms we want to negotiate we need deals right we need great deals with trade we have to you know theyre buying a new efforts billion in spending three billion to bring it up because if i when im going to be the one to use it right so i said it didnt want to bring it up in tonight at break it up for the first time do you think i could make a better deal than three billion dollars for an airplane maybe just i know so much about airplanes when i heard three billion i said rule i said lets buy some of that boeing stopped thats a lot so everybody wanted it hyatt the pritzker family is obamas biggest supporter just about from chicago nice family good family they wanted to say hi everybody wanted to help his trump get the most valuable asset in the gsa the most sought after a sitin the gsa i got it for similar prize i did pay the question i gotta for similar price get the greatest asset in the most coveted as i got it how to help the white get it into your administration its called negotiation i wouldnt make a deal like a hundred and fifty billion dollars to a randomly get nothing ok i would have said i want my present his deck and your hostages i want him back before we even start and they would have said no and i would have said very simply yes thats right you know i said bye bye right we leave the room we doubled up the sanctions within hours they call us they say youve got your prison then what do i do i go back into the room i say and my father always used to say youve gotta take the lumps that he thought everyone was too tough to be soft little bit like jeb bush every once in awhile saw he said son take the lumps yet so i wouldnt say i want to get the prisoners back now theyll and now we call ok were ready to negotiate now thank you for releasing a persons okay again hundredpercent to give them back because you have to ratchet up now we go back out of billion if biggest problem i have with if i win is that they have two hundred and fifty billion that the given to everybody but us by the way theyre buying planes from airbus a hundred and eighteen air planes from airbus theyre buying missiles from russia there in italy by buying from everybody but us so my father would say take the lumps hii go and then say the following im sorry we cant give you the hundred and fifty billion dollars we have a country that bust the country has no money we owe nine trillion dollars were going to have nineteen we own trillion dollars were going to over twenty one trillion dollars we have no money im so they could go nuts to forget about it come on lets say that and you negotiate a deal i would ever paid a hundred and fifty billion dollars but these politicians have no clue a guy like carrie i mean this guy hit do you think you read the art of the deal a guy like carried i think you hit a guy like carrie he never walk from that negotiation ones in a random dancing in the streets calling us stupid people they were celebrating the deal before we even signed it they were saying what a great deal it is before we even saw everybody was saying what a great negotiator the guy on the other side of the table it and he is you know the persians agree to negotiate but theyre all saying what a great negotiators who is like here we can even send it to you when you say if you saw this happening in your the negotiator and i so you say lets walk looking man to deal with stupid and then what happens then what happens so now the deal is done the money is about ready to pass and they catch wonderful young sailors that have a problem with the engine and a citizen lets get it fixed up up up on your way they bring them and they drop them to the beggin position on their knees hands up guns at the head and are rough guy you heard that voice right that wasnt a nice person roughing them up and what do we do apologize i mean it was such a humiliating situation and they would have never given the sale is back but then that stupid people theyre very smart people much broader than our people much larger than our negotiators by a factor of about we would have never gotten the sailors back except for one thing the money was going to start passing two days after they got so we gotta back we were humiliated as a country we gave him the money like nothing happened we are led by these guys they keep coming to me one of them came up to me about three weeks after one of the debates said that mexicos gonna pay for the well they wont pay for the they make a fortune on the wall is peanuts they dont even think he can build a wall i said two thousand years ago china built the great wall of china its miles long they did it before caterpillar tractors were now of course of course china would never use caterpillar tractors why would they use them unless they built the plans by the way on chinese soil so china bit two thousand years ago they built a wall that is this is a serious wall right im look at him you know about that one thats a serious so we need a thousand miles ok need a thousand miles because its two thousand miles but they have a lot of natural barriers lot of good stuff that sucks so we need thousands and i have these politicians said you cant rebuild will you know they wanted to build the wall fifteen years ago and they couldnt do it because they couldnt get their environmental impact study approach did you know that because there was stakes returned as a toads are not sure you look it up a lot of the people that are now against the wall including some of the democrats check hillary by the way check they wanted the wall but they couldnt get it done they couldnt get an environmental impact statement approved can you believe it now you have china in the south china sea theyre building a military base creating an island right smack in the middle of the osha creating an island they have the biggest excavators youve ever seen theyre ripping the shit out of the sea right and theyre building runways and airports that building forts do you think they got an environmental impacts our countrys in trouble countries in trouble so were going to fix it were going wagons were gonna have strong borders would have the wall with a strong strong borders were gonna have tremendous trade deals i have these guys and women i have these people that is the best in the world did the best business people know what i know i know the great ones i know the bad ones i know the over rated ones yet people that you think agreed that the totally overrated i happened to be underrated by the lab but thats okay its good to be very good to be underrated thats why when they looked at my statement i said i think this guys been underrated i know the greatest in the world and were going to use them when i can use the hawks anymore will not be used caroline kennedy in japan to talk about cars what the hell shes a very nice person you know why shes a nice person because my daughter ivanka like sure when my daughter likes her thats good that doesnt mean i want her negotiating with japan on cars ok so some of these people like terrible human beings some of these people are horrible you wouldnt hear you would never ever have dinner with some of these people although the very rich you might have dinner with the matter which does money matter that much she says no ill bet you will but not now these are people that in many cases are horrible people who cares i want the best the greatest negotiators in the world negotiating this from now on were not gonna let mexico still all our businesses and and this has been going on for years i mean you look at new hampshire this is going to happen and were gonna bring business back were gonna have businesses we gotta have businesses that used to be in new hampshire that are now in mexico come back to new hampshire and you can tell themselves because they let you down and they left we want the businesses that stayed i dont lot of businesses appeared out of business up here these are great people they coulda left and they want to stay they want to say theyre fighting just its hard with the highest tax nation in the entire world its hard for them to stay and those are the ones we have to cherish and love these are the people that are great but you dont have people come back down my tax proposal cuts the hell outta taxes for the middle class for business we go from the highest tax nation in the world to a nation thats got pretty low on the taxes ok pretty low on the list but the middle class has been abandoned by our country they built the country the middle class has been banded events have been abandoned thats akin to be taken care of the way they should be wears out the ultimate vet and a loves me right you better love me right this wouldnt be terrible if you said known as the jump i dont love you ill put your hand go ahead say it again now said in the michael you have a mic for a reason i dont judge this man is always there and he goes to others are also and he goes to other people that are running and he doesnt he said he gave up here we go to everything all he cares about is that the vets are taking forever i love this guy special special gonna take care of it you know that sometimes wait five days six days in a waiting room for a simple prescription or simple something a procedure and sometimes they die they die waiting this storys thousands and that you wouldnt believe its possible thousands and thousands of vets die waiting to see a doctor its not gonna happen right its not gonna happen anymore folks were gonna take care of our vets were not even talking about money the fact is that if you look at the money that we squander and steel take a look at arizona whats going on with the va in arizona it should disclose the money that stolen the corruption is unbelievable its all over the country hour ago to be taken care of our military is going to be rebuilt were gonna do things were protecting our nd amendment bigleague big lake were getting rid of common core were gonna bring education to the you know theyre chipping away at your second amendment every time you see something that shipping and shipping if in as you know if in as if in california where you had to do they got married these two people wonderful people barrage she probably radicalized him down those out happen maybe radicalized alright doubted but they go out they worked with a group of people that gave them parties gave them their baby shower gave them so they walk in they killed them fourteen people dead something wrong then you have in paris and a lot of things happened in paris lot of things changed and people like me more after paris which is terrible in a way for people like me more after paris because they want somebody that understands what the hell is going on and i get it in paris have a hundred and thirty people killed dead if we had some people and by the way many many people many many people lying in a hospital so gravely wounded many more tests they walk in hundred and thirty people horribly hurt people lives destroyed people if they dont die if they want guns on the other side if there was like you you that guy right over the tall guy with the red if we had if we had some people on the other side that were being shot with guns wrapped around their ankles are there ways with the bullets could go in the other direction you wouldnt have had the carnage that you had they had nothing remember what i said at the beginning remember what i said at the beginning the toughest gun laws in the world paris the toughest in the world same thing in california if you had people that had a couple of protect our nd amendment protected when i get away just finishing up education is important so i tell you im gonna get a common common car is washington department of education so were ranked as a country number thirty in the world where ranks as a country cost per pupil number one in the world so we pay the most in the entire world for education by a factor that so high that the secondplace contender and by the way its norway sweden denmark china and on and on and then as you start getting up we end up with third world countries that come before us pretty sad right with thirty we have thirdworld countries that have better educational systems in the united states of america now think of this so were number one in cost per pupil and when number thirty will the bottom of the fact wouldnt it be nice ok and i i related to something else like jeb bush hes been a hundred million dollars and hes nowhere at the bottom of the only reason i even bring them up as he does so many commercials of me this negative is so now i didnt even know i was that bad a person i just know this so negative but they cant be that negative because every time they go on my poll numbers go up its crazy but they come in for this campaign i have spent less money than anybody else and im number one in every poll nationally right and by the way im number one in new hampshire will you please keep me there the victim keep me there are you be so happy if you do youll be so proud of that decision believe me believed to be so proud so i spent the leash and i have the best rizzo wouldnt it be great if the united states could do that not only with education with other think we spend the least and we have the best we spend the least we have wouldnt that be fantastic great so were gonna start winning again were gonna win on trade with these other countries that are ripping us off were gonna win on health care were gonna win with the military were gonna knock the shit out of isis but theyre not gonna win on health care were going to win every everything we have so many victories which is that we just cant fail anymore we dont have the option to fill anymore we have a country thats a debtor nation and we dont have the option so i just want to tell you this is

success in a single fields my father has succeeded in many at the highest level and on a global scale hes enjoyed success in a vast diversity and industries because the common denominator is him his

very loyal friend when it comes to building bridges he can do so figuratively but also has the rare ability to do so literally on time and under budget the throughout his career my father has been

country is in serious trouble we dont have victories anymore we used to have victories but we dont have em when was the last time anybody saw uh speeding lets say china in a trade deal they kill us ip china all the time all the time when did we beat japan at anything they send their cars over by the millions and what do we do when was the last time use our chevrolet in tokyo it doesnt exist folks they beat us all the time when do we beat mexico at the border theyre laughing at us at our stupidity and now theyre beating us economically they are not our friend believe me but theyre killing us economically the us has become a dumping ground for everybody elses problems the tackle its true and these are the best in the finest when mexicos sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre not sending you theyre not sending you theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs they bring in crime their rapists and some i assume a good people but i speak to border guards and they tell us what were getting and it only makes common sense it only makes common sense this sending us not the right people its coming from more than mexico its coming from all over south and latin america and its coming probably probably from the middle east but we dont know because we have no protection and we have no competence we dont know whats happening and its gotta stop and its gotta stop fast the islamic terrorism is heating up large portions up the middle east they become rich im in competition with them they just built a hotel in syria can you believe this they built a hotel when i have to build a hotel i pay interest then i have to pay interest because they took the oil that when we left iraq i said we should have taken so now ices has the oil and what they dont have haran haz and in nineteen and i will tell you this and i said it very strongly years ago i said and i love the military and i wanna have the strongest military that weve ever had and we need more now than ever but i said dont hit iraq because you dont it totally destabilize the middle east a rand is going to take over the middle east iran and somebody else will get the oil and it turned out that iran is now taking over iraq they coveted a rant is taking over iraq and they take it over big way we sped to trillion dollars in iraq to drill your we lost thousands of lives thousands in iraq we have wounded soldiers who i love i love take great all over the place thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers and we have nothing we can even go there we have nothing and every time we give a rack equipment the first time a bullet goes off in the air they leave it last week i read to thousand hum these these are big vehicles were left behind for the enemy you would say maybe two maybe four to thousand sophisticated vehicles there and and the enemy to youre right the last quarter it was just announce are gross domestic product a sign of strength right but not for us it was below who ever heard of this its never below zero our labor participation rate was the worst since but they give the gdp below zero horrible labor participation rate and are real unemployment is anywhere from to percent dont believe the dont believe it thats right a lot of people up there cant get a job they cant get jobs because there are no jobs because china has our jobs and mexico has our jobs they all other jobs but the real number the real number is anywhere from and maybe even percent and nobody talks about it because its a statistic thats fallen out sense the our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the day and we as a country are getting weaker even our nuclear arsenal does it work it came out recently they have equipment thats thirty years old they dont even know if it worked and i thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television because boy does that send signals to putin and all the other people that look at us and they say that is a group of people and that is a nation that truly has no clue take dont know what theyre doing they dont know what theyre doing we have a disaster called the big lie obamacare obamacare yesterday came out that costs are going for people up and even percent and deductibles are through the roof you have to get hit by a tractor literally a tractor to use it because the deductibles are so high its virtually useless it is a disaster and remember the five billion dollar website five billion we spent their website and to this day it doesnt work a billion dollar website i have so many web sites have all over the place i hire people they do a website a cost me three dollars billion dollar website where you need somebody because politicians are all talk no action nothings gonna get done they will not bring us believe me to the promise land they will not as an example ive been on the circuit making speeches and i hear my fellow republicans in the wonderful people i cum they all want me to support them they dont know how to bring about the come up to my office i a meeting with reaffirming the next week and they dont know are you running are you not running could we have to support what do we do how do we do it i like em and i hear their speeches and they dont talk jobs and they dont talk china was the last time you heard china is killing us did devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldnt believe it makes it impossible for our companies to compete impossible theyre killing us but you dont hear that from anybody else you dont hear it from anybody else and i watched this features thank you i watch the speeches are these people and they say the sun will rise the move will set all sorts of wonderful things will happen ill and people are saying whats going on i just want a job just get me a job i dont need the rhetoric i want a job and thats whats happening and its going to get worse because remember obamacare really kicks in and obama is going to be out playing golf he might even be on one of my courses i would invite him i actually would say i have the best courses in the world site say you know what if you want see i have one right next to the white house right on the potomac if youd like to play thats fine fact id love them to leave early and play that would be a very good but obamacare kicks in in really big lake it is going to be amazingly destructive doctors acquitting i have a friend who is a doctor and he said to me the other day donald i never saw anything like it i have more accountants that i have nurses its a disaster my patience are decide themselves they had a plan that was good they have no plan now we have to repeal obamacare and it can reap be replayed add it can be replaced with something much better for everybody let it be for everybody but much better and much less expensive for people and for the government and we can do it show ive watched the politicians i dealt with them all my life if you cant make a good deal with the politician then theres something wrong with you youre certainly not very good and thats what we have representing us they will never make america great again they dont even have a chance theyre controlled fully theyre controlled falling by the lobbyists by the donors and by the special interests clearly thats the controller pay i have lobbyists i had to take i have lobbyist can produce anything for me a great but you know what it wont happen it wont happen because we have to stop doing things for some people but for this country its destroying country we have to stop and it has to stop now now our country needs our country needs a truly great leader and we need a truly great leader now we need a leader that wrote the art of the deal we need a leader that can bring back i jobs can bring back our manufacturing can bring back our military take care of our vets our vets have been abandoned and we also need a cheerleader you know when president obama was elected i said well the one thing i think youll do well i think hell be a great cheerleader for the country i think youd be a great spirit he was vibrant he was your i really thought that he would be a great cheerleader hes not a leader thats true youre right about that but he wasnt a cheerleader hes actually a negative force its been a negative force he was a cheerleader he was the opposite we need somebody that can take the brand up the united states and make it great again its not great again we me we need some body we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again we can do that and i will tell you i love my life i have a wonderful family theyre saying dead you gonna do something thats going to be so tough you know all of my life ive heard that a truly successful person really really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office just cant happen and yet thats the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again so ladies and gentlemen i am officially running the for president of the united states the and we are going to make our country great again it can happen our country has tremendous potential we have tremendous people we have people that arent working we people that have no incentive to work but they gonna have incentive to work because the greatest social program is a job and theyll be proud and theyll love it and theyll make much more money than they wouldve ever made and theyll be theyll be doing so well and were going to be thriving as a country thriving it can happen i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created i tell you the ill bring back i jobs from china from mexico from japan from so many places ill bring back i jobs and ill bring back our money right now think if this way out china trillion dollars we r japan more than that so they come in they take a job they take our money and then theyll owners back the money and we pay them in a dress and then the dollar goes up so their deals even better how stupid our own leaders house stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen house stupid art im going to tell you thank you im gonna tell you a couple of stars about trade because im totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons number one the people negotiating dont have a clue our president doesnt have a clue is a bad to go sheer hes the one that did bergdahl we get bad girl they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there we get burger we get a traitor we get a no good trader and they get the five people that they wanted for years and those people and now back to the battlefield trying to kill us thats a negotiator we have take a look at the deal hes making with iran he makes that deal israel maybe wont exist very long its a disaster and we have to protect israel but so we need people on the free trader but the problem with free trade is unique really talented people to negotiate for you if you dont have talented people if you dont have great leadership if you dont have people that know business is not just a political hack they got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign which is the way all jobs just about a got free trade is terrible free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people but we have people that are stupid we have people that arent smart i we have people that are controlled by special interests and its just not going to work so heres a coupla stories happen recently a friend of mine is a great manufacture and you know china comes over and a double their stuff and i buy it i buy because frankly i have an obligation to buy because they devalue their currencies so brilliantly they just did a recently and nobody thought they could do it again but with all our problems with russia with all our problems with everything everything they got away with it again and its a possible for our people here to complete so i wont tell you the story for two months a great manufacture calls me up few weeks ago is very upset as to what you prop he said you know im a great product i said i know i know that because i buy the product he said i cant get it into china they wont accept it i sent a boat over and they actually sent it back they talked about environmental they talked about also to crap that had nothing to do with it i said oh wait a minute thats terrible does anyone know this he said yet they do it all the time with other people i said they sent it back yeah so i finally got it over there and they charged me a big para did not supposed to be doing that i told them now they do charge a tariff or trucks when we send trucks and other things over there s boeing they wanted boeing secrets they wanted their patents in all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from boeing pay im not saying this stupid id like china i sell apartment i just sold an apartment for fifteen million dollars to somebody from china am i supposed to dislike i own a big chunk at the bank of america building in avenue of the americas that i got from china in a war very valuable i love china the biggest bank in the world is from china you know where their united states headquarters is located in this building in trump tower i love china people so you dont like china know i love but their leaders are much smarter than our leaders and we can sustain ourself with that is too much its like its like take the new england patriots and tom brady and have them play your high school football team thats the difference between chinas leaders and our leaders they are ripping us we are rebuilding china were rebuilding many countries china you go there now roads bridges schools you this or anything like it they have bridges that make the george washington bridge look like small potatoes and theyre all over the place we have all the cards but we dont know how to use them we dont even know that we have the cards because our leaders dont understand the game we could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly now theyre going militarily theyre building a military island in the middle at the south china sea a military island now our country could never do that because we have to get environmental clearance and the environmentalists would let a cat we would never build in an ocean they built in about year this massive military port theyre building up their military to appoint that is very scary you have a problem with my sis you have a bigger problem with china and in my opinion the new china believe it or not in terms of trade is mexico so this man tells me about the manufacturing i say thats a terrible story i hate to hear but i have another one ford so mexico takes a company car company that was going to build in tennessee rips it out everybody thought the deal was dead reported in the wall street journal recently everybody thought it was a done deal its going in and thats going to be it going into tennessee great state great people all other son at the last moment this big car manufacture far in announces theyre not going to tennessee they gonna spend a billion dollars in mexico instead not good now for denounces a few weeks ago therefore it is going to build billion dollar car and dropped and parts manufacturing plant in mexico billions could be one of the largest in the world fort good company so i announced that im running for president i would one of the early things i would do probably before even getting and i wouldnt even use you know i have i know the smartest negotiators in the world i know the good ones i know the bad ones i know the overrated what you got a lot of that are overrated theyre not good they think they are they get good stores has a newspapers get buffaloed but theyre not good but i know the best negotiators in the world and i put em one for each country believe me folks we will do very very well very very well but i wouldnt even waste my time with this one i would call up the head of or do i know if i was present at say congratulations i i understand that youre building a nice billion dollar car factory in mexico and that you gonna take you guys and sounded united states zero tax just flown across the board and you say to yourself how does that help us right sign up is where is a good its not so its a congratulations thats the good news let me give you the bad news every car every truck in every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border were going to charge you a percent tax hey and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction and that said heres whats gonna happen if its not me in the position its one of these politicians that were running against you know that people that were already and heres whats gonna happen did not so stupid they know its not a good thing and they may even be upset by but then they get to get a call from their donors or probably from the lobbyist for four say you cant do that to fort because forty takes care of me and i take a review and you cant do that to fort a guess what no problem taken to build in mexico they gonna take away thousands of jobs its very bad for us cell under president trump heres what happened the head afford will call me back i would say within an hour after i told them the bad news but it could be wanna be cool and you wait till the next day you know they want to be a little cool and ill say please please please go back for a little while and ill say no interest theyll call also its a political people and ill say sorry fellas no interest because i dont need anybodys money is nice i dont need anybodys im using my own money im not using the lobbyists are not using donors i dont care im really rich sure that this by the way im not even saying that in a bragger thats the kind of mindset thats a kinda think it you need for this country shell because we can make the country ridge it sounds crest somebody should know thats kress not press we got trillion in debt we got nothing but problems we get a military that needs equip it all over the place we got nuclear weapons that are obsolete weve got nothing we got social security thats going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesnt bring money into the country all these other people want to cut the hell outta im not going to cut it all im gonna bring money in how were gonna say but heres whats gonna happen after im called by friends of mine who contributed different campaigns after im called by all the special interests and by the the donors and by the lobbyists and they have zero chance a convincing me i get a call the next day from the head afford the state please reconsider all say no hell say mister president we decided to move the plant back to the united states were not going to build and much check they have no choice they have no choice there are hundreds of things like that a give another example saudi arabia they make a billion dollars a day a billion dollars a day i love the saudis many are in this building they make a billion dollars a day whenever their problems we send over the ships we said were going to protect what we doing began nothing but money if the right person ask them they pay a fortune they wouldnt be there except for us and believe me you look at the border with yemen you remember obama a year ago yeah man was a great victory red two weeks later the place was blownup everybody get handicapped are equipped they always keep our equipment witness it used equipment right there was keep our equipment this is a real job because frankly it would be where to send our surplus were always losing this gorgeous friend mister but look at that border with saudi arabia do you really think that these people are interested in yemen saudi arabia without us is gone day gone and im the one that made all the right predictions about iraq you know all these politicians and im running against now like its so nice to say im running as opposed to if i ron if i run running but all these politicians that im running against now theyre trying to disassociate me you look to push it took him five days to answer the question on iraqi couldnt answer the question now i said is intelligent and i look at rubia he was unable to answer the question is a racket good thing or a bad thing he didnt know he couldnt answer the question how are these people going to lead us how we couldnt how we gonna go back in make it great again weekend they dont have a clue take it lead us they cant they cant even answer simple questions it was terrible but saudi arabia is in big big trouble now thanks to fracking and other things the oilers all over the place and i used to say it their ships at sea in this was doing the worst crisis that were loaded up with oil and the cartel kept the pressure because again there was smarter than our lives they were smarter than a lease there is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again and therefore make it great again because we need money with dying with dying we need money we have to do it we need the right people soak ford will come back theyll all come back and i will say this this is going to be an election in my opinion thats based on competence somebody said thank you down somebody said to me the other day a reporter very nice reporter but mister trump youre not a nice person that show but actually i am i think i am a nice person people that know me like me does my family like me i think so right with my fam a proud of my family by the way speaking to my family malani a barren chi donnie don venessa tiffany a bocca did a great job did she do a great job great the jared lara and eric im very proud of my family theyre great family so the reporter said to me the other day but missed a trap youre not a nice person how can you get people to vote for you i said now i said i think that number ima nice person give a lot of money away to charities and other things i think im actually a very nice person but i said this is going to be an election thats based on competence because people are tired of these nice people and theyre tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world and theyre tired of spending more money on education then any nation in the world per capita than any nation in the world and would in the world countries are better than i said education and some of them are like third world countries but were becoming a third world country because of our infrastructure our airports are roads everything so one of the things i did and i said you know what ill do uh do it because a lot of people said hell never run number one you want to give up his lifestyle to read about that but im doing number two im a private company so nobody knows what im worth and the one thing is that when you run you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth so i said thats okay im proud of my net with that done an amazing job i started off thank you i started off in a small office with my father in brooklyn and queens and my father said and i love my father i learned so much he was a great negotiator i learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors but i learned a lot but hes to say donald dont go into manhattan thats the big leagues we dont know anything about that dont do it is it then i gotta go into manhattan i got a bill those big buildings i gotta do it dead ive gotta do it and after four or five years in brooklyn i ventured into manhattan and did a lot a great deals the grand hyatt hotel i was responsible for the convention center on the west side i did a lot of great deals and i didnt early and young and now a building all over the world and i love what im doing but they all said a lot of the pundits on television well donald will never run and what are the main reasons is his private and hes probably not as successful as everybody thinks so i said to myself you know nobodys ever gonna know unless i run because im really proud of my success i really here ive employed ive employed hands up thousands a people over my lifetime that means medical that means education that means every so a large accounting firm in my accountants have been working for months because its big and complex and they put together a state financials is a summary but everything will be filed eventually with the government and we dont need extensions or anything will be filing right on we dont need any and it was even reported incorrectly estimate because they said he had assets up nine billion says nice a wrong number thats the wrong number not ss so they put together this and before i say i have to say this i made your fashion which real estate you notes list its labor and its unions good and some bad and lots of people that are in unions and its all over the place and building all over the world and i have assets big accounting for while the most highly respected nine billion million dollars and i have liabilities about thats longterm debt very low interest rates that one of the big banks came to me said donald you dont have another borrowings could we loan you four billion dollars that i dont need it i dont want it and i been there i dont want it but in two seconds they give me whatever i wanted so i have a total net worth and now with the increase itll be well over ten billion dollars but here a total net worth love eight billion net worth not assets not liability a net worth after all dat after all expenses the greatest asset trump tower ninety evony the americas bank of america building in san francisco wall street sometimes referred to as the trump building right opposite the new yorks many other places all over the world so the total is eight billion million five hundred and forty thousand dollars now im not doing that im not doing that to breakers you know what and at the break i dont have to believe it or not im doing that this day that thats the kind of think keeney our country needs we need that think we have the opposite thinking we have losers we have losers we have people that dont have it we have people that are morally corrupt we have people that are selling this country down the drain so i put together the statement and the only reason im telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going because if we have another three or four years you know where trillion now were soon going to be at trillion according to the economist who are not big believers in but nevertheless is what theyre saying that trillion were very close thats the point have no return trillion dollars we will be there soon thats when we become greece thats when we become a country thats on salvageable and were gonna be there very soon were gonna be there very soon cell just to sum up i would do various things very quickly i would repeal and replace the big lie obama care i would build a great wall and nobody bills was better than me believe me and ill build em very inexpensively i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall mark my words nobody would be tougher on ices then donald trump nope i i will find within our military i will find the general patton or i will find general macarthur i will find the right guy i will find the guy thats going to take that military and make it really work nobody nobody will be pushing us around i will stop iran from getting nuclear weapons and we will be using a man like secretary carry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation whose make it a horrible it laughable dale whos just being tapped a long as they make weapons right now and then goes into a bicycle race at years old and falls and breaks his leg i will be doing that and i promise i will never be in a bicycle race that i can tag i will immediately terminate a president obamas illegal executive order on immigration immediately fully support and backup the second amendment now very interesting today i heard through stupidity in a very very hardcore prison interestingly name clinton to vicious murders to vicious people escaped and nobody knows where they are and a woman was on television this morning and she said you know mister juppe she was telling other people like actually called but she said you know mister trap i always was against gods i didnt want guns and now since this happened its up in the prison area my husband and i are finally an agreement does he wanted the guns we now have a gun on every table were ready to start shooting i said very interesting so protect the second mm and and common core common core should it is a disaster bush is totally in favor of common core i dont see how he can possibly get the nomination hes we got immigration hes in favor of common core how the hell can you vote for this guy you just cant do it we have to end education has to be local rebuild the countrys infrastructure nobody can do that like me believe me it will be done on time on budget way below cost way below what anyone ever thought i look at these roads being built all over the country and i say i can build those things to onethird what they do is unbelievable how bad you know what building on pennsylvania avenue the old post office were converting it to one of the worlds great hotels could be the best hotel in washington dc we got it from the general services administration in washington the o parma administration we got it it was the most highly sought after all one of them but i think the most highly sought after project in the history up general service we got it people were shocked trumka i got it for two reasons number one were really good number do we had a really good plan and i lead in the third we had a great financial statement because the general services who were terrific people by the way and talented people they wanted to do a great job and they want to make sure got built so we have to rebuild our infrastructure our bridges our roadways are airports you come into laguardia airport its like were in a third world country you look at the patches in the fortyyearold floor they throw down asphalt in a truck you look at these airports we are like a third world country and i come in from china and i come in from qatar and i come in from different places and they have the most incredible airports in the world you come back to this country and you have lax disaster you have all these disasters airports we have to rebuild are in for save medicare medicaid and social security without cuts have to do it get rid of the fraud get whether the real waste and abuse but save it people have been paying in three years and now many these candidates want to cut it you save it by making the united states by make it as rich again by taking back all of the money thats being lost renegotiate are far in trade deals reduce our trillion in debt because believe me were in a bubble we have artificially low interest rates we have a stock market that frankly its been good to me but i still hate to see whats happening we have a stock market that is so bloated be careful though the bubble because what youve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens so be very very careful and strengthen our military and take care of our vets so so import sadly the american dream is dead but if i get elected president i will bring it back bigger at better and stronger then ever before and we will make america great again thank you thank you very muchthats the man [ crowd chanting ] >> so again we have to thank the candidates because they really ran we have some very talented people and to be victorious against some of these people even if its for one week but believe me its going to be for many of weeks okay they really are terrific a number of them called i just wanted to thank them but i wanted to congratulate the other candidates okay now that i got that over with you know its always tough and then tomorrow boom boom but thats the way it is and really we have some real talent real talent in the republican party and the rnc and reince we want to thank everybody thank you very much well ill tell up what ill tell you you what what do we really want to thank right we

democrat side the republican side money just pouring into commercials these are special interests folks these are lobbyists these are people that dont necessarily love our country they dont have the best interests of our country at heart we were not going to let it happen we cant we have to do something about it bhu when you see the kind of deals made in our country theyre made for their benefit we have to stop it for your benefit were going to make the deals for the american people thats the way it is [ cheers and applause ] i love these signs theyre the most imaginative signs were going to

toughest gun laws in the world these animals go in they start shooting one two three people with many people horribly wounded horribly wounded right now in the hospital if there were bullets going in the other direction believe me it would have been a whole different story folks but nobody had protection i am going to be the greatest jobs president that god ever created remember that dont believe those phony numbers when you hear and unemployment the numbers probably as high as in fact i even heard recently do you have think if we had unemployment do you really think weed have these gatherings forgetting about security forgetting about isis which by the way were going to knock the hell out of isis were going to knock the hell out of them and its going to be done the right way so were going to take care of the economy were going to take care of jobs were going to take care of all of things that i said our border health care its going to be so great remember this about obama care people are forgetting but now theyre miserable because its going up its totally out of control probably sinking of its own volition in unless the republicans give it another i mean whats going on whats going on the budget the last budget that was approved is an absolute disaster for everybody in this country weep owe trillion as of today weep just crossed the trillion mark were going to very shortly be at trillion because of the budget we are going to make our country so strong we are going to start winning again as a country we dont win on trade we dont win with the military we cant beat isis we doesnt win with anything we are going to start winning again and were going to win so much you are going to be so happy we are going to make america so great again maybe greater than ever before i love you all thank you new hampshire! thank you thank you new hampshire thank you we are going now to southwe love you birmingham we love you thank you very much everybody and were gonna have a lot of fun and then get you out to those football games have this many people im getting you outta here im getting you out baby ill go watch one of them with you tell you i love and you do have great teams you do have great football players are great so so a lot of things have happened over the last week lot of bad things actually we have a president whose representatives very poorly very very poorly raptly actually we have a situation where isis has raised its ugly head again and we gotta chop off that had like theyre chopping off heads so terrible you know i i did a lot of tweeting equil donald trump right at real donald trump and i said you can call it dumps theyve got iqs at a low believe me you can call the leader of the dogs a mastermind cant do it ive been watching for a week and now i will tell you i really was it big when i said the same thing and another speech recently got a lot of play you know theyve taken the internet and using it better than our country and certainly our politicians and our executives are using it better than anybody and i were you separable in all fairness this acceptable and you have these kids coming home and they say mom and dad did you see the mastermind to mister major more on that here by the way is also dead which is great and i told us they dont call ms youre building your building up their image you know we have a president that doesnt know anything about what were talking about he doesnt know in iraq he calls to head to supreme leader yes the supreme leader i promise you i will never called him the supreme leader colin hay you hey how you doing are you doing everything good case where were going to renegotiate your deal were gonna make it much better going to renegotiate that sucker piggly and you can you give us back those prisoners before i take office ok gonna give us give it give them back how about that here we have carried who doesnt have a clue week in effective baggage to make a deal and we had all the cards we had a hundred and fifty billion dollars to negotiate with and what happens what happens he is a loser just said hes illusion that such a descriptive term and some of the president user too much for you know went to an ivy league college i know a lot of words but im a loser is so nice to say good work not only in describing certain crippled thats a lot of people a lot of you but you look a hundred and fifty billion dollars going to a terrorist nation they got everything they wanted about the self inspection they self inspect about that one when they dont jump inspect we have hours meaning they get hours that shoots into days but the twentyfour hours could go on forever before we get the approval to start the clock ticking for the days but even if it did twenty four days we think you doing something wrong oh ok comeback in days was by that time i have it room clean i used to clean garages for my father and i always used to say clean and my father was said to me son i want that garage in mint condition used to use the term mint condition just a term used immaculate not like what we do nowadays things arent so immaculate thank you i dont know i think he said something thank you but what happens what we need what we need is we need leadership so badly we can be so great again well left that where scott that were rob was clear on what were up you look at the original you look at the prisoners so you say why dont we have a back and they said because we didnt want to complicate the deal you believe it so we have four men over there right now in the worst of the worst i met one of them a christian pastor his life twice so lovely cannot understand nobody is fictional but he calls a nobody talks about the negotiation and that should have been done early did you ever see a deal to make sure were giving them all of this money that people are still pouring in europe so lucky to be in here by the way look at people a lot of people outside by the way if you want we can wait about an hour and everybody if you want to do that to be angry theyll be pouring in and by the time the last one gets in ill be saying goodbye make america great again goodbye darling of the people but that deal there and it took so long to do one of the big magazines call me up and said tell me how long should have taken a shit day maybe of you doing poorly two days to give it a week weve been negotiating this thing for years so heres my man over there look at that book called that book i dropped the art of the deal he read it you shouldnt negotiated for us get me that book of luck w that book bring up took over here bring that book over here bring it over here let me that book ill sign it i mean any guide that much we should send a copy to obama and to carry believable health science books during his speech with me is just racing again about books go out and get crippled american believe it or not doing great but i think really like the art of the deal was the hardest i have worked on a book that i had a lot of bestsellers right after that but it didnt work so hard this is the second largest ive ever worked in a book there it is the second hardest and it talks about america i mean it talks about the problems of our country but it also talks about how to fix the problems you know like critics i never liked even movie critics theater critics they complain but they cant do it themselves you know i dont like people that complain so we talk about fixing our country towards thank you fellows its very nice noticed group from alabama i mean the guys up there hi mr tumble you sign the book im making this feature but the answer is yes thats what happens when youre aggressive hes an aggressive guys are you looking for a job ill give you a show the iran deal took so long we didnt get anything we lost every point went on forever during intermissions theyd be celebrating in the streets of the negotiators and as obama would say the supreme leader would stand up at the podium and essentially say that the united states has really really really stupid leaders you know if i would doing a deal and somebody said the kind of things that they said and all of us because sadly were into the category of been there representing us i would never go back to the table now in the case of the prisons they should we want the prisoners released from now three years ago release them now you dont need him you dont want to give people dont even know you have them released the prisoners now itll be good for the deal itll set a good really good tone released him now we want to do that and ill say bye bye and ill leave the room ill then double up or triple up the sanctions i guarantee you within hours they will call and they will say we are going to release the prisoners but were not doing it because of its threat to you know that a yes ok were not doing it because of the threat but we will release the prisoners and ill say thank you very much now we start negotiating then id say listen one thing youre not going to get is were not gonna give you a hundred and fifty billion dollars without giving too much money too much money so much you know theyre supplying many of the weapons being used against our young men and women over there you know that the road bombs many of the weapons that are being used are supplied by a ring that was when they were poor now theyre rich as hell how stupid can we be as stupid can we be and thats just a look thats just one of many ok so heres the story ive been coming out and ive been talking for much and i hate to say im a politician you believe it i have very little respect for some fun but i have almost no respect come down the politician and numbers just came out flat do we have any politicians in the room raise your hand yeah there are some of the back excluding them theyre fantastic leaders i dont know im excluding them there anybody in the room thats a politician i think youre fantastic but outside of this room they dont have it folks they dont they dont have so ive been doing this since june and the pundits all said hell never run and then i read then they said they get paid money to some of these guys got a half a million dollars if you watch on the various networks cable and other was the room what with me that been wrong all the time im driving them nuts they dont know what to do they dont know what to do not know they dont want you i am driving them bunkers guys like george will i swear you know he looks like because he has a little glasses if you take the glasses away from him hes a dummy he needs those last theres little spectacles united seen that before who else use glasses peri peri use glasses they always have to me everyone but but these pendants show they said hell never run with such sure you know there was some sure hell never filed for may thats what you sign your life away its only one page hell never fun for me i filed for me now they said we got problems then they said well well never filed a private company nobody knew how well i was doing it you know they said he wont fight for their just maybe hes not as richest people so what happened it turned out almost a hundred pages of the biggest one after me was like three forever im not talking about not talking about it almost a hundred pages so they said hell never file and he does file you know youre entitled to massive delays you can delay it forever so that nobody gets to see you request to delay so he does file he requested the delay and delay will take forever will never get the season jones and i said so not only did i not ask days and you can have days another days then you can request special i couldnt take that long after the election the election but they said so not only didnt i s four delays i filed and opened it up early early less than and i had a team of lawyers and accountants you wouldnt believe and we filed this message of state and it showed that a much bigger much richer much too much anomaly by the way the reason im saying this because they only show that but then im going to show what im gonna say much bigger much stronger much richer the companys phenomena some of the great assets of the world manhattan the rally in miami hundreds of acres turnberry scotland one of the great places in the world home of the open championship one of the most important gulf term you know tremendous cash very low debt and my state gonna file it anyway people dont know you know these guys said hell never file babies not as it turned out much richer much much by two three times what they thought and even a better company now they should we have a problem with the reason i tell you the last part is because thats the kind of thinking thats the kind of mentality whether we like it whats in there or not thats the kind of thinking and mentality that we need in our country we need their i didnt want to do this you have a nice life i live nice we have a wonderful family did anybody see barbara walters last night owl night owl not sure she barbara walters did a big special one hour special last night on my family and myself and it was really nice so it was really it was really know they do it because its good to get good ratings i have to tell you they dont do it for my health but she was graded shes alleged shes probably the greatest in the history of television greatest female greatest woman and in my opinion in the history of television so she called she said would like to do it profile a one hour profile so those of you that did get i dont know how to help you see its already over right but youll see itll be around but it was great i think it was really very successful so what happens so what happens is we really need that ability because we have to take our country back we have to bring our jobs back we have to bring train we have to repeal obamacare we have to replace we have we have we have to have to build and we well i dont be afraid it will be a great we have to rebuild infrastructure our roads our bridges of them a dangerous can you believe you drive it over a bridge innocently driver that collapsing you know in china they built bridges that make the george washington bridge look like peanuts have built in little over the place they believe the peanuts we dont do this anymore we dont do anything with building a bridge in the san francisco bay you know whos building at the chinese are building a bridge for us costs over a massive they dont know what to do and this is whats happened so were bringing our country back so whats happening is until the attack in paris i was doing great i was talking about trade because were being ripped by china japan everybody and youve all heard that you know ford is going there you know nabiscos leaving chicago moving that big factories moving that plant where they make the areas that i will never eat again ill never see them again im not eating them anymore which is good for a lot of reasons but im not eating or if no other areas go is moving their big plant out of chicago and into mexico how is that good for us its that good for us folks i went to the best school have dragged you dont have to go to the best you have to go to high school to know its not good its not good for us and too many things so i be talking about trade i love talking about trade i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created that i could the best and every poll cnn the one with the cameras all over the place look at all those cameras back to believe you know these other guys they come up with their biggest each first of all instead of having people that have like or on a football day they might have none but that have very few they would have none of these guys back there look at all those guys highlypaid highlypaid i think of a good people would look at all but happen when they make a speech nobody was around the same thing over and over and over and over and nobody cares about a different group of people i made a speech in new hampshire recently i had people only determined by the size of the room i had people jet bush jeb bush down the road yet a hundred and twentyone people and you know what my audience was energized and his audience was like one sominex his audience was sleeping were doing great its a its a message but heres what ive been focused on ive been focused on trade because i dont wanna be somebody we have somebody from time magazine media cover recently now they hear again so i assume theyre considering me fun man of the year but a few people i dont know i dont know i say theres no way they give it to me they cant because mentally they cant they just they cant do it even if i deserve it they cant do it you know when i had the apprentice it was the show that first season second season and everybody should trump is gonna get the nme its easy hes gonna get the emmy for the apprentice and by the way their renewed for two more years than i said im sorry im not doing i love the apprentice but i cant do it but everybody said i was getting the apprentice and we went to the emmy awards my wife and i and they should ladies and gentlemen the next distort reality television its been a spectacular show hes a spectacular host its been an amazing year and i stood up and started walking there was nobody even close and they said the winner but thats the one thing that could have been having the biggest crowds by far bernies crowds attention bigleague nobody cares bernie sanders getting he was second i was by far in mobile alabama i mean we have a lot of people but it really at people but in all fairness we didnt have football games all over the place but bernie sanders he blew it during the first debate he looked at hillary and he said the emails its wonderful its fine so he got it twenty second sound bite he got some applause and guess what hes gone and now its a whole different thing honestly even as a candidate should be so easy to beach is going to be easy to be but ill tell you his number one she doesnt have the strength and she doesnt have the stamina and we need a president with unbelievable strength and stamina and how does not happen she doesnt have his strength or this down and bernie sanders hes all over his upper add about the other guy omalley his credentials hes the mayor of baltimore ok he did a great job in baltimore that it became the governor he was a thirdrate governor but he was the mayor of baltimore now im gonna decide to run for president while we have these are professional politicians all good is running for office its all good they run they win they lose they run they just run thats all they do im against it right now and i have to tell you some of the people that are running against i like and respect some of my like and respect some of them should not be there some of them should not be there you want to know who i dont wanna do i want to be nice i said to myself im going to be nice to you know i said i told a lot of the people back said dammit some of the really great people backstage with a cat pictures have a lot of fun i said im going to be nice today im not i said it i said it i am not going to call jeff bush low energy im not going to repeat it im not a lightweight i said im not doing it i will not do i said that i will not say that ben carson last week was a bad week because his top person and his top consultant said hes incapable of learning about foreign policy thats a bad thing and i wont say that he said in his book that he suffers from pathological disease i said im not gonna say it im not saying and im not saying that he won after his mother and wanted to hit her over the head with a hammer who does and that he tried to stab somebody but the belt the belt got in the way and i fell to the ground broken and that his friend in the face with a padlock so im not saying any of those things about any of those people is that ok all right i mean explain what are we doing so in the polls in the polls i got five part number one leadership by far by far one of the economy it was so leadership in the economy was so off the chart like well cnn did it and there are other people cnns back there is that right cnn i got these cameras if im telling a lot i got problems youll be reading about it tomorrow so i killed them on leadership i killed them on the economy killed them on the military and whos going to protect from isis be so good for you im gonna make our military is so powerful so strong so strong im gonna make it so incredibly powerful and strong that will never have to use it nobodys gonna mess with us folks that toy with us you know how to keep her out the door that would be so powerful you know how cheap that is we have a president that we have general central television general id like to ask how we doing with not good if theyre very very tough enemy not well general chat with me down i dont know let me tell you my generals are gonna kick ass then im going on television you know im a big fan general george patton now he was a horrible human being he was terrible language he had a lot of problems but he was one hell of a general thats what i want i dont want this stuff anymore i dont wanna im a big fan also of general douglas there right very opposite he was a man with tremendous style the corncob pipe the hihat the whole thing to get out of the plane like the enemy was like to him they were like garbage out of my way because he had a tremendous you go we dont have that it we have we have said lightweight people we have a bunch of light which we have people that shouldnt be doing this we have people that shouldnt be leading us we are people and you know what in our services i will find the general i will find the guys we have we have generally got the we have general patton you gotta know how to figure people we put people because we had one general who is really tough i wont say his name but he got fired because he was very very nice that he wasnt politically correct and everybody said he was up as general and they use foul language all the time and he got fired because they interviewed him and he was cursing all over the magazine bring back we might bring back is very good but thats what we want its like again i can be more politically correct than anybody that lives on fifth avenue or park avenue you much of which i built by the way you look i have a better education than almost all of these people you know i actually the other day i think her name is cokie roberts what a likely she was on morning joe morning joe is saying how well trump is doing in the polls oppose what were doing and then im saying to myself you know they talked about these people as intellectuals im much more of an intellectual a much smarter than them i mean other people that are running our and i went to better schools generally i want the best schools i went to i did well but im sure i have in my opinion a much higher up tattoo but then i say i hear that will you know the intellectual elite of washington did not even smart people most of them not even sports people and the reason i dont believe too much in political correctness because it takes too long we dont have time to be politically correct we gotta kick ass and get our country going to have to do so and were doing well so last night late great poll camel riders reuters they dont know me they usually write bad stuff about me they dont even like the right so you know waiters alright then they love to repair the good stuff and they say i said what about that story to write one group associated press guy calls were doing a story on the us and the story is gonna be the right you were doing a negative service actually there were four deals that werent great but i made a lot of money with them thats not being so what about the good deals you know where another job i made hundreds and i companies i made hundreds and hundreds of good deals hundreds even time magazine is on the cover about the girl and they put some why do you do that why dont you put the good deals dont want to do this i dont know why i actually think it sells better she make hundreds of good deals youve built up a tremendous net worth tremendous they want to read about a couple of deals that werent so good that i was really tough and i beat the banks they have headaches and you know what thats what we want i think and by the way just so you understand these factors are like you know you think of the banker controlling that the little old womans money that way these are vicious sometimes terrible people so you gotta win so whats happened just reuters last night comes out with a pole drunk carson honestly hes dropping like a rock i do we have any carson fans here because hes dropping like a rock points out so im now remember thats where people so how do you have percentage carsons at rubio is that can and cruises at seven so were winning were winning big in a place called alabama florida just came out dropped theyre sitting senator and carson sixth inning all over the country well winning in ohio against case it is totally overrated by the way were winning all of somebody over there you know you have one guy over there shouting we have thousands of people and youll read about him tomorrow theyll say the room with had a ticket to hell out of here with you please no matter what we had at the other day i got criticized we had it the other night i had a lot of people and one guy who was seriously obese he complained when i mention that food stamps we have a lot of people on food stamps and the guy went crazy and they said that was a politically correct errors we all have a way you can get them out about the hell outta here here yet out no matter here did you see bernie sanders said he was politically correct to young women came up to the podium they took over his microphone i promise you thats not going to happen with me i promise never gonna happen not going to happen cant let that stuff happens so whats happened that is ive been talking about trade up and talking about all of the different things much of what youve hurt and then a week ago we had a horrible incident in paris and you know what my home speech change and now its about security its about borders its about protection its about a lot of things ill take care ill take care of dread i can do that out of my back pocket ill take care drake china will not be taken advantage of us any longer japan will not be taken advantage we have a four hundred billion dollar trade imbalance each year with china not gonna happen but what has happened is the conversation has change of people in our very much involved with isis and alqaida and all of the things that were going through with it and do things that are very smart and we what happened really people should i wonder will this affect your number one they thought maybe this would affect things and you know what it has affected me weve gone way up weve gotten way up because people know that im going to protect them im gonna protect him at the borders ill walk the people from syria coming in because we dont know who they are we dont know and i dont wanna be coming in we are in a position now where when we completed our country is going to be greater than its ever been we have to move quickly we have to move quickly we cant afford to lose another election we cant afford week i think im a very nice person i think a lot of people think that people that know me think i do i pride myself on it but this time its not about nice this is about real real competition cuz we have to bring our country back we have to bring in the new york times they had a report on the front page it was false really false that was today how you want to see something funny look at those cameras turned around there following the few people that are being thrown out that would his now whats this look at those bloodsuckers back there theyre turned around and theyre following the people right because you have a small group of people that made some noise it being thrown out on their ass right now is look at those cameras and yet whenever i speak when we have crowd like this all over the place much bigger than this you know what confined to fight the fire got your fire guy said we cant have any more people in the room it wasnt designed for this many people so we have crowds and my wife calm and i say how was everything because its on cnn its on so many different places its gone away right now entering its all of fox everything so i say did you see the crowd sure what you mean no no they never show the crowd they always have a fixture in your face its always fixed and they dont want to show the cut because dishonest people now theyre dishonest people the media is so dishonest like this story on the front page of the new york times today front page i love being on the front page and im from new york new york times front page but its a full story and breitbart wrote it correctly and now the time just suffering but they write for stuff and that had to do with whether or not we register people ok and i want those people coming in from syria that obama wants to let in that people are fighting but the republicans so far have been very effective with a fighting we finally when the senate we have the house nothing happens its always the same we dont have two victories we dont have the victory so what happens is the rightful stories and in this case they got called out by a lot of people because you know you can only go so much ok but these guys tell me no no we have to have it fixed because sometimes also in oklahoma we had twenty thousand people recently in a field it was supposed to be at a hotel then the convention center we had to go to a field because it was so many people we had twenty thousand people in oklahoma good football place pretty tough football place so what happens i said the place they refused to throw the cameras stationed i said they would his to every one of them they refused to fit everyone and now im looking and theres a few people that were shouting that got thrown out of here and i see all the cameras are turned so they can turn the cameras these are just lying people that bad new book the pressures really bad the cameras over here fellas fan the camera shows they dont do it they dont go they dont do it they have very dishonest people they tell you you dont know they dont do it youre watching television you wouldnt know if there were people in this room are people in this room they do it in the room fell lets go ahead and the room look i dont do it they dont do it because theyre really dishonest people now minutes ago those cameras were turned all the way to the back of the room where the other people belong there were terrible people there in the back and defending and theyre showing its disgusting be ashamed of yourselves hellas so now now what happened yesterday some little wise guys he looked like he was years old got a camera im signing autographs and im going like this question talking about the wall to wall built this would end up signing autographs and theres music playing in the background and im leaving being being being signing and israel wise guy sitting there and hes asking the questions im its not even important that i should who you with you shouldnt be she wants you said that i didnt bother answering anymore cuz i know although they did you mean saturday night live in there was good how about the other guys about the other guys they now want equal time ok like like pataki not gonna help hes got zero they could give him saturday night lives on our behalf but not gonna have any effect will still have zero but thats what they want so the database but they also said the world and i said the wall and i was referring to the world but databases ok and watch list is ok and sure villages ok if you dont mind i wanna be i want to surveil i want surveillance of these people that are coming in the trojan horse i wanna know who the hell they are and the biggest story yesterday the biggest was trucked wants database certainly whats happening here and i spoke to the reporter the times and i think i did it and i also said number one you couldnt hear very well because its like walking over here you know being but regardless of that doesnt matter what i do want database for those people coming in but i also insist on the wall and it was all fun so his district just to set it clear i want surveillance of these people i want surveillance if we have to and i dont care i want are you ready for this folks are you ready dl gonna make it so big he said something so politically incorrect thats why were going to hell because were so politically incorrect such a big deal i want surveillance of certain box so can if thats ok i want surveillance and you know what weve had it before it will happen again hey i watch when the world trade center came tumbling down and i watch in jersey city new jersey we have thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down thousands of people were cheering so somethings going on we gotta find out what it is i do want your village i will absolutely take data based on the people coming in from syria if we cant stop it but were going to win ive made it known if i win theyre going back we can happen then going back we can have happened and you see it very clearly a few nut jobs in paris ok a few total not lowlifes the guy with the dirty hat they say they got him i hope they got him hes wearing a filthy dirty hat that was the one they were calling for five days the mastermind mastermind mastermind is a low life but they got him but theres others out there we have to get up and we have to use surveillance wait we have to use surveillance we have to be vigilant and you know the greatest thing is everybody in this room everybody outside of this room we have tremendous eyes and ears when somebodys next you in a house or an apartment good to see the something going wrong inform your local police their incredible people to police their incredible people theyre incredible people you dont have to call washington when youre trying to figure out who the hell do i call i just met a lot of your police right now when i came off the plane these are incredible top cookies they want to do a great job get them back their power and youre going to see a lot of good things happen and sure about the way youre always gonna have a bad incident at a bad up when you have that in any business no matter what you gonna happen but we need vigilance when you see something going on at the next house at the next apartment when you see certain people walking in and out all day scouring things inform your local police whether its birmingham or wherever it might be they will take over they know what to do them call washington theyll get the guys those guys dont have a chance but the eyes and ears we have millions and millions and millions of eyes and ears you can solve the problem is nobody like the people theres nobody like the people so we are going to have a village we are going to have the most interesting thing that happened is all of the talk about it because that was the other thing in the polls that trump is by far by far the best on border security so thats why when paris happened the attack in paris thats why i went up because people said hes the only one that says it like it is so i went up and believe me youre going to be really secure to be more secure than even you know and you offense ok youre gonna be secure were not playing games were not playing we will not be playing when i brought up illegal immigration it was like like a bomb nobody was talking about this subject i brought it up and rush limbaugh good guy he said nobody should die right good guy good guy really a fair guy and he says the true maybe thats because he likes me but rush said nobody has ever taken incoming nobody like donald trump and for two weeks i did believe i said its just gonna be i cant do this the six seven months but then it died down because people started seeing i was right and then i became the darling and then you had a lot of bad things happen you had kate in san francisco get shot in the back by a guy that came over five times probably pushed over get out of here we dont want to take care of you let the dummies from the united states take care of you and he shot beautiful kate from san francisco in the back holding her fathers hands looking out onto the water and she dropped the father and the family will never be the same great family and then you had jameel whose son is so great senior and junior and the fathers the apple of the fathers right great football player getting ready to go to college was gonna go on a scholarship never had a trouble in his life walking home from the deli where he bought himself and his father a sandwich called his father said pop ill be home in minutes and then the father heard a gunshot outside her door from the house and he knew immediately there was a problem and he ran out of his son was laying on the street almost dead with bullet holes in his head with his hand blown off course he was lying down going like this in his hands were blown off it was a and then you have three four weeks ago you had the woman a veteran year old veteran raped sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant raped sodomized and kill years old and so many more people should then you have the drug problem our cities are infested with drugs our youth is going you should see new hampshire has a heroin problem the likes of which nobody can even understand its coming from an area that we can step because its destroying our cities its destroying most important is destroying our youth is destroying our future and were gonna stop it stop were gonna stop all of the other things that i usually talk about is now there are very important dont get me wrong obamacare we mention trade we mention all of these things are all very important jobs jobs we mentioned im gonna create so many jobs we mention but let me just tell you but what were going to do is were going to be vigilant at our borders and were not letting people come into our country unless they come in legally theyve got a commonly they gonna come in legally or theyre not coming in at all and were not gonna be this stupid sending more with the stupid when known as the stupid its with the anchor babies a person has she walks across a line she has the baby in the united states now we have the baby th amendment except for one thing they didnt read the fourteenth amendment right because it doesnt say that it doesnt say that it doesnt say that and for years ive been hearing it but for years ive been building buildings he created jobs ive created tens of thousands of jobs ive been doing jobs so i never really gave it that much thought but now that im doing this i want to make our country so great now that im doing this i said it cant be right now if somebody has a baby in mexico they were ok but if they did and you should like a dog and by the way that show with almost every country but here you have a baby and now we have to take care of that person for eightyfive years or however long that but it doesnt read that way then they said all you need a constitutional amendment which will take you years and years you dont need you need a simple act of congress and in my opinion you dont even need that because if they come in illegally theyre not supposed to be having a baby here so i dont even think and were talking about hundreds of thousands of people so heres what were gonna do if i win a lot of good things are going to happen first of all were gonna win so much were gonna win were going to win so i sometimes i like these people much better he says when we win we are going to have so much victory and a joke about it you can have wins and wins and wins you gonna get sick of what i cant joke because you never get sick right your football teams if your football team goes undefeated every year and every year you never get tired of it but were gonna have great victories again we dont want any more as a country we dont win we lost on everything we lose with ice as well as with everything when we lose with health care have you seen the premiums on obamacare up percent its a disaster and now theyre saying its a disaster and now theyre saying we have to go back to congress because in seventeen it all exploded whoevers gonna be president is not going to be easy but ill solve the problem but its not working and i give you my i wouldnt work so hard im self funding this campaign im the only one on the online im the only one i dont know thats a big deal to lot of people but i could have i could have fun you know these super pacs are a total scam the super pacs have all this money theyll do negative ads and me all over the place a lot of will be false its also but by the time i end up winning what happens is its too late the elections over so what do i get the super pacs are a scam they have total control over the candidates they do whatever the person that puts the money up once if a man owns a company in china and he gives money to a super pac jeb bush was over as an example wanna keep using his name but hes so hes so easy to sell his jet which was over in germany as people are over in germany trying to quell a german company has gotten a big approval from united states cut thats what happened folks i know the obvious theyve worked for me nobody knows the game better than i do i dont want anything i work for you i work for you i worked i dont wanna i dont want it were going to do whats right for the country were not gonna let mexico take our car purposes which by the way theyre going to become the car capital of the world pretty soon ford is building a massive plant there others are building massive plant we dont even vote we dont even fight you have corporate inversions which by the way the other candidates dont even know what it is but essentially companies are leaving the united states and going to other lands to other countries and theyre dropping thousands and tens of thousands of jobs and now its starting to get that and under my tax plan when cutting everybodys taxes bigleague big lake and were cutting corporate taxes with the highest tax nation in the world under my plan will be one of the lowest and were going to be a dynamic economy again were gonna be dynamic and were gonna bring back those trillions of dollars trillions of dollars trillions that companies cant get that they cant get it back they cant get it back because the politicians they all agreed to come back but they cant make a deal because theres gridlock in washington so we gonna bring it back and that money is going to be put to work here and were gonna do think so what youre seeing in front of my call me up he said some believable whats happening what youre seeing is a movement this isnt about me what youre seeing is a movement no matter where i go to same thing its the same love is like love in the room is love in the room with other peoples love in the room and the american dream and i said the american dream is dead but were gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before and we are going to make america great again thank you i love you thank you thank you thank you everybody i love you gonna get it donefor me and i felt much better but they were all waiting and its going great how are you doing great here and were doing great annihilating now in the polls in iowa everybodys a great trip but we set the record on the groups i i love you too darling who said that stand up i love you i love you thank you and i love that book you know i want to thank joe dugan who has been fantastic he is a good guy really good guy puts his heart and his soul into this and nothings easy in life i can tell you but jones been doing it for a long time so hes a very special guy we have a couple of things to discuss you the beautiful thing is that i dont use teleprompters because i speak from the heart right in and and ahead but the heart perhaps i go the head first and then the hard cuz maybe thats more important nowadays when you look at whats happening to the country but i like to be able to talk about current events and when you read the speeches you know a lot of the guys get up and they read a speech bob up they leave in minutes everybody goes what happened thats all there is you know like the song is that all there is so we dont read the speeches in we dont do the teleprompter thing but a couple of things we talked about the debate because it was a great experience its been a great experience for me has been for me for me has been a great experience and i did i guess they do who said their stand up as rain as well weve had some interesting debates in an interesting time and it is different job bridges i built a great business but its been jobproducing and employ currently thousands of people and over the years tens of thousands of people many hispanics and i say we gonna do fantastically with hispanics i think were gonna do incredibly with the africanamericans where i pulled her well and somebody said there was a poll that came out at twenty or twentyfive percent and they said have trumped gets of the africanamerican vote the elections over you win i mean you win but we do program and we both just pulling a me no matter where i have a list of not getting over it very much in this group is a very intimate friendly group of friends but and normally i love to go to the polls because im number one in every poll virtually and i love i love to go but im not gonna bother other than to say new hampshire through the roof going all over we are not playing games were not gonna do what they did the last time if you remember the last time we should have beaten barack obama should have beat them something happened something happened and im not blaming romney but you gotta work last month that last month was important than whether you like obama and not every time you turned on television he was on jay leno and letterman and all these and our representative wasnt and we gotta work and we have to work hard and with a win this thing because having four more years of barack obama but i think perhaps worse depending on what happens with her and her now maybe these guys will look at all those cameras back there well thats very impressive that is very very impressive i thought this is going to be just a little quick stopover with my friends from the tea party and jerry and joe all my look at that group of people i guarantee you they werent here for the other groups i guarantee i and i know you know its always tough when they come in every speech made in the last two or three months has been alive television right they can have a speech which isnt allowed television no no good i like it i would love to do one or two before this campaign actually thats not good because that means things are not going well if they stopped turning on those televisions that means they so will continue to go live ok but it it really has been an interesting period of time for me because ive been a businessman and i negotiator and a job real estate person that a lot of different deals but mostly and i had a great time i love the real estate business all over the world doing deals all over the world were doing a deal right on pennsylvania avenue a big hotel thats going to be spectacular right by the white house its sort of interesting is one way the other im getting to pennsylvania be here or ill be here that so much difference so its one way at any time interesting its the post office and everybody so many companies wanted its one of the most soughtafter projects in the history of the general services administration and its an incredible building the old post office and we we got it which is amazing we got it in the obama administration can you believe how can you believe it i was even surprised i said you know i think we had the best plan they wanted to make sure everybody was very strong financially because they want to get it done its very important economic and economic development and we put our plan and others but you know great companies many many companies in great company is the biggest hotel companies in the world and we were given in about two years ago we started construction and were about a year ahead of can you imagine that a year ahead of schedule under budget and ahead of schedule which is what the country has to do is really what do you think about the country so were under budget substantially and and i will tell you under budget and yet were building even beyond because its so good were gonna make that we think its going to be probably maybe the finest hotel in the united states were going beyond that but its going to be one of the finest hotels in the united states i have one of them right now in chicago is considered one of the great hotels of the world i think this is going to be something i wanna see copied you dont see top your own stuff but this is something that the beauty is that when you hear those words ahead of schedule and under budget and i think thats so important because i mean i see these projects and i read about the projects are in about one the other day where you know the building an airplane and its its five times over budget and its years in years late sometimes decades and by the time they get it its obsolete in there spent you know billions and billions of dollars and you look at what they do with these submarines in the nuclear submarines and all of the tremendous cost overruns that they have and i just got a building what the hell you doing and you gotta get it done with the contractors and theres so many soon as i can tell you about government i mean a little ones just quickly as the woman eight years and the city couldnt get the ice skating rink open in central park and i got involved is when i was young but theres nothing different i mean theres no difference i just did one recently which is almost the same thing entry point they couldnt get his big golf course project open hand has been under construction they think for thirty years it was a landfill and they dont even know when it started a long time ago and it would have i think it would have gone on for many many more years and i got it done in a year its open now just got the best best new course in the united states and one of the big magazines and is doing great but it is not that big i mean although they i tell you something worlds most expensive government spent over million dollars maybe seven you know but they spent over million dollars to build i think its much more than that nobody even knows who they know they have no idea you know when you say you to know the money and here were talking about local government can you imagine what the federal government is wasting and when you see the kind of waste fraud corruption its incredible with a woman drinks ahead and ice skating rink and have a daughter ivanka who everybody knows shes a little bit oh yeah and she said to me daddy id like to go next year to learn about it would look down in the ring and that she should come let daddy and its it maybe its really and then finally after about three four user asking me its a nice simple but its a nice ring as massive as one of the biggest in and to this day been running ever since but it does great but i said about four years of risk and i said and i went down and i look until hundreds massive piece of concrete you know probably six seven eight times the size of this room and i said workers in the raw sitting there and has been going on for years and years and years and i went to the mayor of new york city with the time was a mean forget about her but the whole city they can was like on the front page of the papers again get a nice getting so it was that easy with him believe me because he didnt want to be stood up it was a very paranoid guy that i can tell you and finally went to the newspapers i said i want to build it i want to get it open i get it open for months now i cant do it for two million dollars i will pay for the course myself and they had spent probably you know they dont say theres another universe find out with these i think theres been over million dollars and i said i spent and most of the money that has been spent a lot of loose demolition began to tear down everything anyway finally he agreed to let me do it i took it over and the ice was melting ice and the slab was poured in other words its gonna be level so the water is in icu create one part the water was like a foot and a half high the other plotters down here so they could make the water and i should be so in a rip out the entire slip and then i saw the man who was the freezing man i said where is your office located in miami beach miami beach he said no ive never done and we focus on air condition is it that makes sense i like air condition but i dont so i said well whats the problem and i said you know what i friend of mine works for the montreal canadiens ice hockey team is great in house he comes down he looks at me sees it comes close minutes after he said mr trump using free hun you want to use water was so should you have free on their pouring you have to see this they have tubes of of copper and the tubes of copper miles long as it goes from one side after be three inches apart goes back forth and it put the copper and copper is very expensive and very valuable so every the copper that come back the next day was all stolen ok so they delayed again atlantic and then finally they werent hired a big security company that guards all around the rink and the other problem with this whole miles of this stuff because its so long and if theres a pinhole the gas escapes and you know me so i said to him whats going on so they finally got security and they were great they did for seven days and then the security took a day off the entire inc was wiped out that it was this years somebody made a fortune on comp anyway so i get this guy john nice guy from the montreal canadiens real hockey people in nice people and he said what you want is a rubber hose you put water in it and you put salt in the water and assault means the water can trees he said we called brian and a machine and the machine takes it mixes put it through its simple and you need rubber hose nobody steals per i guess a steel rubber to write that new york you know maybe theres still a maybe they wont actually new yorkers have very high values that wants two hundred and nobody stands nobody steals and nobody shoots self so we laid miles up i took out all of the country we laid miles up of the rubber and we text tested were no leaks no nothing to his know that because nobody wants and we laid just beautiful then we called up the concrete guys we have we had the most incredible poor because its such a huge slab and ideally you want to port city doesnt know so weve been the construction people report a onetime beautiful job and the cement mixers were lined up this is at th street the cement mixs were lined up to harlem all the way back thats a long and they poured all day long they portrayed in half and was beautiful perfectly level done with lasers anyway bottom line turned it on what the brian truitt the water and beautiful eyes to this day and identify less than two million dollars and they study it now and we can do the same thing on aug its the same its no good its not very funny i like i like newt gingrich actually newt gingrich i like newt hes a great guy and he called me up he said you know i read the story about woman would you please tell them the story of wollman rink so thats why i havent told us that story is honor of newt what he really thinks its because its indicative of it finished way ahead of schedule and today its probably the busiest ice skating rink on a saturday have lines of her four blocks long to get in and people are great and the place so if you have knowledge like you dont use people from miami beach to do rain with you know and by the way they do use you know use freon server uses we have an air conditions a little different than i wouldnt want to use brian for that but its sort of you have to use people that know what theyre doing but newt columbia bc you gotta tell the church is at such a good and its been its been a great thing and and cities a lot of money and its been its been really great expense and actually study of the great business people with private business government and is something very true about that we have a lot of we have a lot of things have happened since we since we made this journey and i journeyed fourth and it takes guts and on june sixteenth do this and ill never forget standing at the top of the nowfamous escalated as youve seen that picture with myself coming down with mama mia and ill never forget looking down into that basement level and seeing all of these guys are what you have down there as much as you have down there now times and it looked like the academy awards and we gave a speech and we talked about illegal immigration rush limbaugh said hes never seen incoming like he saw with incoming means trying to get you and then it turned out the killing of cape and you had your meal and you had so many other things happen the veteran sixtyfive years older woman years old a veteran of the army and she was raped sodomized killed by the legal and so much so much and we have strong strong strong build a war and you go up and you go up to new hampshire its amazing his new hampshire their amazing people and have a tremendous you wouldnt think you know you dont equate that with one of the first questions i get all the time and it pours in through the southern border and believe me when im on stage with these guys ok and its now guys doing the other one which is fine when im on stage with these guys doing this so theyre saying and i like some of that they did not think it makes a fortune the wall is peanuts china miles long two thousand years ago and my ambitions have always be much higher as i could be much bigger gives you the window that was like three times wider than this room we dont need to with we need the height but china built a wall two thousand years ago thats thirteen thousand we essentially need a thousand miles its miles but we really natural borders natural barriers and a very very so were going to build a wall and mexico mexico i love the people of mexico many many mexican people and i do business with the leaders at coming to shock and people could come into the country to a process they gonna come in legally and were gonna have a country back because right now we dont have a gonna be a beautiful whats going to be a big wall its gonna see the ceiling the ceiling is peanuts believe me this is not a wall many times and thats where this web somebody ever get something that i gonna wanna come down version so were gonna have a great wall and its gonna do the trick and you know you can ask about walls because israel about walls is work when you have the right wall and when i see the way we negotiate for instance wild years about the prisons are gone the hostages are four people so lets start with the other day we had sailors who innocently probably went a little bit of water that was not a big deal when i saw the young people on their needs in a bag in position with a heads above the head and rifles pointing at the head and i heard the voices heard it because downplayed it is the first this was not a nice character and i and you know theyre trying to downplay it as much as possible and then finally they released him billion so ive been hitting them hard and i think i might have something to do with it is using its a part of my staples inc i mean i go crazy when i when i hear about this you go you go absolutely wild because we have one whos in there was a reporter for the washington post didnt do anything wrong by the way he had something but you have you have a person whos in there because hes a minister is a christian pastor and you have people that didnt have one of the worst prisons world and we should have been done right at the beginning they should have said listen we have a president would say no you leave the room that the sanctions are within hours but we waited and waited so heres the deal they getting you know they get their money today or tomorrow so the prisoners are going to be relieved when they get the money hundred and fifty years before but theyre getting seven people that theyve wanted much more serious real people real people meaning they committed real problems and theyre getting i guess fourteen or fifteen other people that are on the watch list of tara and other fees are really bad dudes and theyre being taken off the water so they getting essentially people and a hundred and fifty billion so we give them that we give them a hundred and fifty billion dollars we give them essentially people people but these are people that really did have problems and were getting better for people that didnt do anything thats the way its sad its so sad and this has been going on forever bergdahl we get bergdahl a dirty rotten traders right we get bergdahl sergeant bergdahl how did we get bergdahl we get there and they get people killers that are back on the battlefields depressing still not back them back by people that they most wanted their back on the battlefield or will be high level people that they wanted for nine years so we get a dirty rotten trader and i fly back linebacker drop a ride to hell right now i would drop them five people at least it could be six but at least five people were killed looking for you know they went out looking from this is not friendly territory and they went out looking for at least five people were killed killed looking for birds and their burgers and let people know the old days when we were strong as a country would have been shot it wouldve been like fast trial fair trial of his guilty hes gone right now there have been forty fifty years ago twenty years ago at least be imprisoned for ten years ago he would have been in prison maybe six people five people more shirts because they say another one and i saw the parents and they think but ill tell you we have to change our ways we have to be smart we have to be vigilant we have to be tough i turn on the television today what do i see islamic right right radical islamic hotel blownup blown to pieces hundreds of people horribly wounded and burning in running onto the streets i mean they say killed it was as of this morning when it happens you know the tremendous gotta be careful what you choose to do this we gotta make sure the syrian the migration we dont know where these people come from we dont know where we dont know whether we have no idea you know the story the trojan horses could be the ultimate but we have no idea where they come from i have a big heart i actually do the worlds most militarised at present but that doesnt mean i want to use it i want to have it because we need it and im the one that didnt want to go into iraq and youve seen that in you heard me say it in then headlines trumps is dole going to rocky gonna destabilize the middle east trump writes in his book in the year about osama bin laden and i saw on the television and read about in the papers and threatening to take him out nobody took him a chance to take about bill clinton actually had a chance to take him out they never pull the trigger youve heard that and they decided not to pull the trigger and they pulled the trigger it probably wouldnt have had that destruction as he was really in charge of that whole world trade center horror show that cnn visions so some people say oh dropped his return in mid their little like bush bush is like low energy lost another really does is run for office he loses debates but he said i think of who won the debate to drop when the debate you know the polls indicate for every day virtually every debate the pozole indicate they do the polls drug use an amazing guy is a poll time magazine slate all these you know they all have these polls pbs online possible for everything i love when your number one of a number to ensure the number two i wouldnt even be happy being number two mean im thats what i want every poll every poll the online polls a comeback in fact my daughter goes did you leading in the polls leading and every time we have a debate and but sometimes the pundits on so good to me other words i may be leading big million by to you know second line percent think of it and then i was like donald trump people this is the first debate with actually see one they said i want finally they getting some are they getting what i enjoy i enjoy the process but we have really more fun i love that is amazing company plans a lot of people say youll never run and then the pundits and they said i never signed for may pages basically is cited because you know hes probably not as rich as everybody so i put in my financials them anyway because i would want to show because nobody is true its people donovan sampling the financials and you had to see these guys see that group all those people back there there it made them look like peanuts waiting in front of the federal election trying to find him and everybody and the funny thing is i had almost pages of financials and with tremendous numbers and hes gonna ask given days so lsu extensions beyond the election fellows any extensions whatever it is it is we filed the numbers of interesting very little debt tremendous cash let some of the great assets so many as his own world bank of america big chunk bank of america building in san frances avenue of the americas one of the biggest office buildings in new york and so many others and he said whats and we need to get our country will trillion dollars they just made this budget deal thats how you know they made it they didnt like in one day right one day it was done in one day i never saw and im actually more disappointed and republican but im more disappointed with republicans because the concern right democrats said the other day obama is the worst negotiator ive ever seen except when it comes to negotiating with the republicans any great negotiate right its true i mean a much more disappointed with republicans and it went so quickly took like a day it was like they said theyre putting in a budget and you took it about a budgets gonna raise up the debt from to trillion dollars very quickly and it really it funds obamacare funds the syrians coming in and funds people coming in through the border i dont know what these people are thinking about you know we all put and party with tough i tell people supported by the way have to take some getting great support from evangelicals every group and its amazing people amazing they want one thing they want to make this country great again and wanna make the country great again theyre amazing dedicated wonderful americans and they want to see good things happen to find the tea party and sometimes i say maybe we should work on a public relations drivers and they want to see this country gets strong be great again pay less taxes make the dollar stretch better have strong borders protect the second amendment which were going to do to get rid of common core i mean when when guys like when guys like bush come down and then lindsey graham supports him but i dont know if lindsey graham even knows this but bush is in favor of common core nobody can win when youre in favor and hes also weaken immigration member they come across the borders and active loved remember i heard those days the common core act of love and lindsey graham supporting i like i like him now that hes out he gave him but he supported in favor of common core and also so you know its one of those but it doesnt make any difference cause lindsey is going to give him all of his people that voted for lindsay you know that is everybody that voted for lindsay right everybody that voted for lindsays going to say everybody is going to push and say which went down time in the accident which is hard to do when youre three you know what i do like talking about this video he keeps takin ads about a look at what he keeps taking these days spending a fortune ads against and about seven or eight guys before he gets to me i would if i were him honestly id take a guy in front of a couple of giessen rights dont you think that the guy up here because he may do damage to me which should be fine but you know hes not gonna benefit one of the other guys gonna benefit so its a little stupid but this kind of thinking we have going on his but but think of it and i use i use jab as its a shame to his last name what is a good brand is making a mistake jeb with you know with the exclamation bush its ok if it doesnt work any worse than it is now right two percent ok but heres the thing is so jammed has spent this is like the woman skating this is like the hotel right under budget ahead of schedule me so jabba spent million dollars so far would be great if you could give that money to the wounded warriors than wasting least you know his campaign manager these ppl ago now buying ferraris and stuff i assume im in an hour but theyre making a lot of money i heard he took millions of dollars in texas never get the texts he took you know why they dont spend the money the guys in the campaign can take it commissioned ok does anyone know that you know vicious that is telling you working in those campaigns is better than being a real estate broker in south carolina its terrible but japanese spent million dollars and essentially the bottom of the barrel like nothing like nothing and im way ahead amway up by points or something i mean twenty points ahead theyd like to have points points ahead and i said oh and by the way just so you understand i dont want to be like somebody said why i said two reasons number one chance ok i just what i authorize a pretty big by in iowa new hampshire and south carolina but i said i mean if you look at it i just feel guilty i feel so guilty because i havent spent anything and all these guys and i feel a little bit guilty and sometimes i say why arent you spending because they have a lead me what they call it earned media and you know like face the nation the other day i did raise the nation two weeks ago and i got a note from very very nice from cbs they had the highest rating and by the way this was like cameras running this is legit stuff they had the highest rating in years since the fall of the world they interviewed they had the highest rating million people they do meet the press had its highest george stephanopoulos the highest ready so that gives you can get things but when you have because they want you when other people whose names but when other people call it a day can edge against me but when other people call it didnt really care about ratings if you had terrible poll numbers right i got good ratings which usually doesnt work usually they go hand in hand but they dont give up on them so when you have the ship so i have a lot of earned media so here i am i spend no money practically no money most of its the fuel for my jet then they say he leases it from himself i see i have to at least by jet market value and pays so that thinkers trump is making money on this campaign hes paying themselves funny myself we had one headline that jump may be the first candidate in history to actually make money running for president were at and were selling and we are were selling those donald j trump dot com right was selling the hats hats make america great again the shirts we sell in the dotcom a handsome young and were doing but anyway i feel guilty and i really do and i just want to do it and i dont want to take a chance so were spending money now its really wasting but heres a look at it and million under budget i think i think it by by january first which is couple of weeks ago i would have spent million i think that was the number right around that time spent nothing some so far under budget so if you dont mind and i love telling the story that i spent nothing and im up here other guys spent tremendous amounts of money and theyre down in the toilet right i love telling this because if you can equate that to the country think this in education were number one in the world in cost per student by a factor of many in number two is way way it doesnt even exist practically we spend more per pupil than anybody else by far and yet were number in terms of quality so we spend more than anybody else and to a large extent thats common core you know these people are making a fortune they dont give a damn about your kids in south carolina at some of them doing a lot of them dont they want to know how much are they getting paid this week and they do things in the right things and you studying things you know you dont want to be so what would it be nice if so we spend the most amount of money and where a you know doing horribly we have thirdworld nations that have better education than the united states and yet we spent many times more than what anybody else would it be nice if you could take my campaign we spend the least and we have the best we spend delays and we have the best and one of these kids have you know i i think its norway sweden china you know some of these places have phenomenal educational systems and one of the folks who tell me actually an iowa they said is to try their trying to get us to go to norway so we can do that so easy but they wont let us from washington itself and his appearances of people that really love the students these are great people that love to students love the teachers want to have the right teachers theres no way of supervising it from washington but norway sweden china these are places that have unbelievable areas of education and i think norway and sweden alike number one and two and they study they can implemented because washington so money and with a big believer in education used to cut it short his strong borders we can have the wall when i get paid for it to be a beautiful someday though the trouble to have to make it beautiful as opposed to were gonna make it beautiful and very effective ok were going to take care of our military were going to rebuild it wouldnt be so strong and by the way thats cheaper than what were doing now what were doing now is insanity will week and they know a week you know when you hear were not going here were not going there i been sayin bomb the oil for how many years you been listening to three years there just became rich with the bomb the oil in a one of the reasons i cant believe it they actually said its true to me its hard to believe its true one of the reasons it in one of environmental pollution its a true now they say the smoke and everything going into the atmosphere is bad for the environment not true and i dont know maybe they were kidding from the white house maybe they were kidding i dont think its anything to get about environmental pollution so how do you think general george patton he needed people in that thing how do you think general george patton would feel about environmental pollution does three years ago and if the president said no way hed say oh im sorry president id like to apologize when general douglas macarthur and we have general douglas macarthur and we have george cat right now coming out of west point coming out of an apple is coming out of the air force academy i mean i went to a great school but i know those goals and those are great schools we have great people but a lot of times our great and tough and smart go to the top because theyre not politically correct one of the guys too tough hes too small he uses bad language or she rushed we need smart tough people we had to let our top people go to the top when it comes to trade with china with so much money with japan china vietnam is a new and mexico everybody beats i know this nobody ever calls carl icahn one of the richest people he doesnt care he does he care about the money he wants his hundred and he wants to do something if i took getting killed with china trade and by the way they come they dont pay tax when we send any attacks and you can even get your product is totally unfair trade a five hundred million dollars hundred billion deficit then some enjoy your not a free trader this attempt i mean how long have to be a freetrade lose five hundred billion dollars a year right and you know the funny thing if we have a tough and come to the table fast because they would have a depression that likes of which nobodys ever see we have rebuilt china chinas done to us is one of the greatest chefs in the history of the world we have rebuilt china and nobody and i mean beyond obama im not just play my obama has done nothing but nobody nobody has done it has been going on for years and years and years with drugs so what im going to do is have country with spirit we can have a country with smartest and brightest people i know who they are and ive been there ive seen the greatest negotiated overrated something underrated some you never use the people that know how to do it they using right now political hacks the using people they gave campaign

stone his tone is very tough look what the world is doing hers theyre beating us militarily we can beat isis theyre beating us militarily theyre beating us on train we go into iraq and we spend billions of dollars in iraq billions and then we spent with the final number whats the final number two trillion dollars we lose thousands of lives in iraq we have haunted worries why i love all over the place and what we have we have nothing we have nothing and you remember i said keep the oil keep the oil and did a lot for three years and been saying keep the dead people saying what has dropped to about this about a week ago this sunday knocking the hell out of the oil but theyll beat up but they wont keep him because in action on enough we should keep it and we should keep it correct belongs the spoils were the only people we go in we fight we lose most importantly and sadly we lose lives we spend trillions and trillions of dollars we leave we get nothing now iraq has taken over iraq and whos taken the oil isis isis around is gonna walk in i said dont go in and im the most militaristic person in this room other than this kind of scotlands pretty rough but im the most of cnn but you have to know when to do it you know when to using i want to build our military so and so strong nobody nobody nobody got a message and weve gotta take care of our vet sarah greatest paper we have pets that are in waiting rooms four five six and seven days before they can see a doctor and theyre dying before they are literally dying by the thousands waiting for service and in some cases routine service they need a procedure they need a pill they need a prescription they die they died and these are the people thats why were here were gonna take care of our vets went to take care of our wounded warriors who are greatest and most incredible big with the wounded warriors and within minutes we take the oil and we get the families that lost people in iraq and afghanistan and other places we give them money will let them have money because they need they gotta get something they gotta get some and we take care of those people we take care of our vets we take care of our military we got into it and were going to do it and were going to do it as soon as i went by when im telling you we are going to be so proud of our contract again where iran who laughs at our stupidity gets a hundred and fifty billion dollars we make a horrible deal with day areas before we can go in and steal and destroy the days its a whole procedure so the days can be much longer and how do you like where they can sell a rare and can go and selfrespect and all mister president everythings hi this is carrie this is they didnt read the art of the deal they are grossly incompetent people they werent meant for the job and we gotta get about we gotta get them out hilary is going to be just as bad hilary is going to be just as dead if you look at hillary hillary thank you thousands of people are pouring in and we have to get rid of one person is wasting my time people coming come out it is amazing people pouring into this room with all of the people here we have to waste time when one or two people its really ridiculous in my opinion she does she wakes up she doesnt have that she puts on a pantsuit she walks in four days five days you know why she goes that calm as she goes to sleep this is not what we need is a president we need tremendous energy we need tremendous smart we need somebody thats gonna get the job to get the job done you dont talk about this is much for the last two weeks because im now drunken more and more border security went to build along mexicos gonna pay for the law were not going to let people come into our country that we have no idea who they are where they come from them no documentation trojan horse these are the strongest looking people ive ever seen the migration theyre all men who look at this young man i say why are they fighting for their country what are they doing so were gonna linda shaw his effect so i said they want to about and ive heard that number im pretty good at this stuff and if you look i made a lot of right decisions listen to this so they say how it was three thousand hours tent house but in the democratic debate what was the number they talked about they want to allow two hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand and in my opinion how stupid can we make we know nothing about these dreams we dont have any idea where they come from military and the police have told us the military and the police have told us there is no way in a million years of finding out where theyre from i mean we cant even do a website for obamacare we spend doing the website and with some guy comes who doesnt have and i do like this we all have heart and i do like building in a safe sun some places here thats what merkel shouldve done instead of whats going on in germanys a disaster and will contribute and well get the gulf says who are so well will contribute will help because we want to help people but we dont want these people coming to the united says and if they do here they do i dont i win theyre going back theyve gotta go back we r trillion dollars see theyve got strategy one there one here one in three different places so self our really i think it might be three so remember this were going to have our borders back were going to create strong borders and i mean strong we are going to build a wall so powerful and so tall and so strong and we let people come in but theyre all coming in legally we wanted to come here legally or illegally what ive been doing is talking very strongly about trade and china and how everybodys ripping off our country and how we dont know what were doing over the last couple of weeks since we had the tragedies we all had the tragedy in paris now we had another one which again was the same thing how about the person that knew i was going on said they didnt wanna report them because they think it might be racial profiling did you see that i did you see that and im not sure do i believe the president be that dumb but they didnt want to report cuz they didnt want to be involved with racial profiling we have become so politically correct to we dont know what the hell with doing made that announcement it takes guts to run for president dont get it tax cuts and not so much for a politician and when and by the way watch the super pacs because the super pacs are controlling the politicians have total control over the politicians and those are the guys that youre elected no super pacs hear those super pacs we send notices out we dont watch super pac so we set about strongly so just remember that a controlling your destiny and these are not people that have you in mind these are not people just remembered for his another line another can imagine look at the camera so what were going to do now and what ive been doing is i really focused on security we need now security proper security we have to bring the safety of our country back when i was running and gave it a very strong announced and i talked about illegal immigration and boy did i take heat or wat i do now what i was right and i think that was maybe what drove us initially now everybody is saying and we have this right here on the economy dropped percent on budget on illegal immigration on isis on foreign policy people know whats happening we want protection we watch smarts and whether to have the finest country and will get only my second amendment and were going to protect ourselves only after its amazing when you think of some of he brings you here where lets not have guns but you know one thing the bad guys have the guns the bad guys are gonna have the guns its not going to happen anymore were gonna protect our nd amendment and we are going to have protection drawn we get two questions will do question and answer before we do that common core is a disaster we have one of the worst education systems in the world were ranked th in the world and we spend more money per pupil than any other country by far thats going to end of local education were gonna have local education and were gonna go shooting up the charts and were going to save money so i want you to ask some lets you have a mic was the mic ok lets get with me somebody doing horrible terrible question what would you like to go to turn on the mind whos running this place try somebody else i hear you i was wondering what you would say to president obama im sure they did everything they could to try to cover that up come out it has been stated that gays and it was a terrorist attack was handled that well i would happen soon enough you have no idea you dont want to hear by the way if the people in paris for the people in california if you had a couple of folks in there with guns thank you jobs illegal immigration have no idea whats happening we are losing our jobs you say in san francisco jameel you know jimmy is wonderful beautiful young boy shot shot instantly killed for no reason and i got to know his father and his father is a great man and what hes living with now nobody wants to live with shot by the illegal immigrant we gotta stop it and when to stop it now going to stop it now prison you and your administration prosecutor or at least look into it because you know the statute of limitations use what she did is illegal is no question about that shes being protected by the democrats because shes there we have to do something about it we have to do this not right general petraeus essentially got two years i mean what this event they destroyed him either people went to jail for much less than when she did i think shes gonna get off and i think its going to be her greatest achievement shes had to get off it will be her greatest achievement because she was one of the worst in history the world blew up during that regime and world blew up so were going to take a look at it very very strong get treated in many cases better than our vets happened to happen you look at whats going on our events are treated so poorly its not gonna happen and its going to happen and you know i mean you know i made her george given a look at senator mr trump is your super fan from the washington post article from jenna johnson we love you and how quickly can you kick common common core how quickly its going to be done got some of these guys running against the republicans dont want common drawer and anybody that wants common core is not going to win it makes no sense so youre a big opponent and take care of your mommy im ryan porn year campbell university representing students for drama i want to first of all thank you for breaking this damn established really have a washington dec do you plan to do an office to support the students that support the education system ok its the question i probably get it has more than any question students they work a barrage of the hell they get in there they graduate they do great big problem they get out the jigga jobs weve taken our jobs back from china would take it i jobs back from japan would take it i jobs back from mexico when you get out of jobs to do something with your loans because the students are getting socked and the colleges are raising their numbers too high too fast too high and too has yet to be very happy to watch when you get out you dont have jobs of america question do you fake the refugees that are coming here are trying to come here theyre going to germany all over europe do you think theyre going to become priests and become celibate what is going to happen to the women in the world that there are countries are contingent questions that one more time what do you mean they are trying to get into russia ok give me another george years old and im scared what are you gonna do to protect this country years old what do you want to do to protect this country im scared try the next president of the united states shared our country and i know you will you will build our military youre not going to be scared to be scared and just so you understand when the world trade center was knocked down the people the animals and did that they sent their wives and their families back to saudi arabia know someone back to saudi arabia those wives do what their husbands were going to do we never went after we never did anything we have to attack much stronger we have to be more vigilant we have to be much tougher we have to be much smarter or its never ever going to end remember that just remember china our technology from our military from our business is now can you stop that its crazy its gone too far and so amazing how old are you thirteenyearsold a year with china seventy

your country back are you do to change obama rules of engagement to get military to get a better chance to stay alive i dont think i dont think he has changed you know our country is divided look at what our country is so divided this hatred between people we want to bring it together you know the country always thought that president obama would be a cheerleader hes been a great great divider im going to look at a level of hatred and you know if i could speak to these four people look you may be a democrat you may be a liberal were going to make our country stronger gonna make it good to create jobs i really think i could talk sense into him so divided as such as i remember thats only four ppl ok hello my names sean i had a question for you so first of all i read the art of the deal and i love the bus so much was great my question was what will you do and regulating hedge funds and wall street wall street has not been babies and what we have to do and what we are doing and i dont

rage way down its going to be so beautify corporations and companies and small business is they are going to benefit we are going to have a dynamic economy again were gonna start manufacturing gonna bring trillions of dollars into the country and you are going to be very happy so were gonna work and you know i was not a bad couple of words they really do produce yet but theyre at a disadvantage now june we have created a tax so many people love him its going to be dynamic the middle class has been so hurt in this country theyve been destroyed its almost like we dont have a middleclass the middle class in this country actions lets go one last question what would you do on your first day in office oh i love that question number one id signed an executive order ending obamas executive order quickly and we are going to help our backs and you know what im doing i put in a big policy paper and people love it when i immediately got his start building up our military and making it really really powerful strong because nobodys gonna mess with us okay then were gonna do many other things and we are going to end obamacare ok ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen this is such an honor when you remember this remember this i think he came back i think he came back to worry about him individual people are all friends they all want to make sure we are sitting on something thats bigger than any of us understand your nose i always made our country great again and ive been saying for the last three weeks ive really got to know the people we are going to make our country great again greater than ever before i love you thank you very muchgentlemen please welcome the next president united states donald you know i missed we got down like everybody else have to get out i was watching today television they said well if we get by far the biggest clubs like its not even a contest and they said all of those people actually go out and vote but you know the designers perspective they should but i dont think they will i think they will but they said they said no they said if they actually go out and vote the people that show up like an iowa had massive the same thing virginia dallas oklahoma south carolina north carolina we have these massive rallies and its incredible and they said well if they vote trump wins they actually said probable and we have to get out we have to get out we have to be ok so you know weve had some amazing news ive missed as you know for like a week and a half weve sort of been in limbo right well i could do is tweak it was driving me crazy because there were no like events or anything planned but we all had a good christmas right merry christmas we say merry other people wont say merry christmas happy holidays happy holidays merry christmas from the polls have been fantastic you see in the polls are just came out of today one came out rasmussen where im tied with hillary but dont worry thats going to and were going to be going to be far ahead and bought came out a couple of weeks ago and we were leading and another one came out we were leading were doing very well we havent started on her you know she said wed love to run against trumpeter worst nightmare these people these people that care they said well the hillary campaign said theyd love to run yeah he wants to run against me instead of somebody else i guarantee you you know and i explained i tried to explain to chuck todd all these guys you dont understand when they say they want to run against rum that means they dont want to run against you dont they dont understand you know their report yet but then tonight somebody reported that they are absolutely going crazy and they are devastated over what trump assange now were getting back to the basics ok look at whats happened with the republicans every single person thats gone after me is gone theyre gone theyre gone when i take on the left the race down and the very very low portion there you just said one but they lowered all the millions that were spending and spending i guess so you saw the one where i spent essentially nothing and bushes spent fifty nine million hes down toward the bottom with three percent or percent or something and we have we actually had a poke about we had percent of these polls its crazy we have we have numbers we have to go through them right go through a first second we have you know they always say why do you go through the polls cause im winning honestly if i wasnt i have to be honest if i wasnt i wouldnt be talking about him and the other characters he always talks about the polls we dont when they shouldnt because theyre not winning so we have a lot of good when cnn think of it crews to carsons rubios christies for bushs after how about this you spend fifty nine million dollars in you but you know whats impressive is that the economy trump is on the budget numbers how about this i remember that set of people you know what outstrip its going down going to go down quickly by the way when they have to take new hampshire will always maintain its place if i went ok just so you understand you know theres a big move theres a big movement to put you at the back of the pack or the middle of the pack so it would no longer be the same thing youll never see me again but you will see me cuz thats so many friends you never see a lot of people again but theres a big movement to put new hampshire way back i dont know why i dont know is it retribution is that they dont want it i dont like it cause you have a lot of power mean you have a lot of power and by we could we get to have problems i mean they have a heroin problem thats really incredible i mean i hear so much about that from the people up here and you know were gonna build a wall were gonna have a real bored at home heroin thing i tell you what we gotta get it under control but i hear more about it from here than i do you dont think of it in terms of new hampshire but whenever im up here i hear more about it here and we gotta solve the problem we got help the people that are cooked because they get hooked and its not easy but on the budget and its with and actually when they did this fifteen people see a id be happy about what do people right ok on illegal immigration listen to this because they know im not gonna play games i saw one of the people that im running against the other day they came up and they said were going to build a wall first time he said that my wife was less you should totally hes coming you said the exact same words he said was gonna be a big wall its gonna be a great wall i said the same words i listened to it i listened to it i said what are we doing here the guys you know if you remember when i started when i started this whole dialogue and we announced on june th at trump tower and i said illegal immigration and was gonna stop at everybody should all and i went through in the papers and i was getting absolutely rush limbaugh was like a great guy said hes never seen anybody receive so much incoming i was getting these guys were killing me and then within twothree weeks all of a sudden its sort of like people saying you know i think is right and then you had kate beautiful kate from san francisco and jameel from los angeles you had a woman a female a better in a wonderful woman year old veteran who was raped who was sodomized who was killed by the illegal immigrant who is here was not supposed to be here came in a number of times like vacate the cake horrible person came in five different times at least the piano and all of a sudden and these are just three instances we have thousands its its out of control horrible for the economy taking our jobs taking our money its a oneway street they come over they bring drugs drugs drugs you people know better than anybody cuz youre really the recipient of that but they come up with drugs and go back with cash ok not a good deal and they go of the walls and you saw the ramp they built a little ramp the walls are built to ramp to trucks drive over the wall they have jeep still loaded up with drugs they drive over the wall didnt even ripped the world down the wall so small that said lets just put a ramp up i would have been easier they shoulda rip the wall then no those are not trump all they are not true so illegal immigration isis isis will get the hell out of them were gonna get the real general they may not have nice language you know we got one of the best shows because he was very rough and tough even though the men and women that were under him loved him but very tough and gave an interview and he used that language and you said things and you know now of course our general shouldnt be talking they should be shooting they should be out there did you ever see general surgeon to view those on television generals and theyre always say how bad we are the shit one of them just like they were going about isis so what do you think its a very tough problem for us up front can you imagine general douglas macarthurs problem he come up with this corn cob pipe in his head and i will be or general george patton it would be over fast it would be over it would be brutal but it would be over we wouldnt be fighting the endless ward how i have been saying take the oil balm the oil killed the oil for years they started doing at weeks ago and they dont do it right you know why they dont want to hurt the environment can you know this is a true they dont want to hurt the environment ok we are now we have a president that considers global warming to be more important than fighting wars of people that want to blow up our country blow up our cities kill our people and he said global warming is our biggest problem i i dont its hard the whole thing is crazy the whole thing is crazy ok foreign policy trump wins with so hes just some good numbers morning console listen to these numbers i dont know they write i think forty percent for trump for crews everyone else way below that abc washington post great company right i dont love the washington post actually because they dont but they treat me good in the polls hey nobodys gonna say they give me any favors that i can tell you percent then you get into the singles right the monmouth mall to ppp iowa came out recently to trump over crews they dont tell you that they only go to one point register which i have a big problem with between that between that and the union leader which i think might be worth a lot a lot a pile of garbage at newspapers about that you check out you about what happened yeah you know youve heard a lot of the story so lets talk about the union leader how dishonest okay cnn right monmouth mall a fox fox numbers item and election but today i wanna on the way in iowa in iowa a cnn poll which was so onesided that it never gets reported other than by cnn actually at cruises adorning thats an iowa poll you dont hear about it they only talked about this crazy bloomberg whatever it is paul it was you know what she was frankly fine but it was one of the few polls room actually behind its iowa but and and i think the people and i would think were gonna win it and i really glad we have like new hampshire like south carolina you know we have great friends and iowan and i think were gonna win my people think were gonna win but well find out i mean were gonna find out if we dont know what to do well but i think were gonna win it ppp thank you win new hampshire right its so bright you know its like this everywhere and sometimes you know were only confined like this a room that we have people outside of get to a second one after this you believe it unless you want to give them your location and let them switch just no i dont think you but we have we we have such incredible enthusiasm you go to these meetings and even the press the rallies and even the presses its incredible when we were in oklahoma people standing in a park we could get a building called it we just said lets do it in the park was a very windy day so i put that on ok very windy make america great deal of that and in dallas we had twenty thousand people in the mavericks where the mavericks play mark cuban was going to give us the arena and he he he said youll fill up fast and he was right we started into thursday on a monday we were packed and were actually packed before that but on monday we came and it was an amazing event and in mobile alabama people we started a hotel ballroom that after about two minutes that was no good because the people you know they heard we were there we dont have a long time you know we set it up like a few days in advance sometimes but in mobile we started off at a bar we went to a convention center which held ten thousand after about two hours we realize that was gonna work to just went to the football stadium the place was packed you probably saw that so we we just in phoenix we have people its been unbelievable you saw the other one when we pulled the plane up in front of the big hangover i was a mess of anger place was packed we get a little show with that plan ill tell you that was going to write that was a good visual we everybody everybody loved it but it was it was good that plane was made in america we dont say that thats going so we had ppp you have quinnipiac my favorite quinnipiac and as i said cnn in my favor so i think were going to do great and im looking forward to iowa and you know it down to almost like for which can you believe this i mean how quickly occurs when i started on this journey whos actually june sixteenth but thinking about it a little before and it takes guts to run for president really does especially get on that a politician never did this before im self funding by the way all these guys that think theyre all bloodsuckers theyre all taken money theyre all control theyre all controlled by the people to put up the money believed me and i used to put up a lot of money i paid three hundred and fifty thousand to the republican governors association recently you know just a little while ago during the year and its understand it but and im not blaming anyone system and its but its a bit system in terms of making our country great again in terms of rebuilding what we have to do the infrastructure in terms of being smart like for instance putin said trump is brilliant and drop them no i dont know if we did see well we did do minutes together now we werent together but he was on i was on the same night we got great ratings by the way even even cbs ill admit that we got great read it but it was put in trouble on sixty minute but he came out of his brilliant trump is leading the pack dropped his deposit and my approach is not terrible that he said whats terrible lets get along with people what is terrible will do fine believe me were gonna do fine but having russia on our side instead of you know these guys want to start some of them want to start the third world war lets start third world war lets have no fly zone let you know this is what these guys wanted to let you know whats up shooting down everybodys airplanes over syria homs syria i think maybe we have other ideas but if they want to bomb my sis i said night said this right from the beginning you know it it russia wants to go and buy my sister i agree if russia wants the bomb meisters excuse me go ahead hey and they dont like i was in a better than we do for dinner you hear the whole thing that we cant fight syria and a saw whos not a good guy but with backing people to fight a sudden we have no idea look at hillary clinton what happened with libya look at no now look what you did with it you know you take a look at you take a look at you look at obamas done with iraq i mean a red is becoming did becoming a force we gave them we gave them a hundred and fifty billion dollars we gave them everything they wanted we didnt win anything we dont even get up prisoners back and you look at that deal and you just see gross incompetence grows stupidity thats what it is and now i ran is taking over iraq and i said that you know twenty i never put it together and put things together really quickly especially when it involves a economic so i said that i ran made the single greatest deal than ive ever seen me and im

nobody want nobodys gonna mess right now general odierno when he left he said our country is the least prepared than its ever been talking about the army was on television to get all these guys are you know what if i had one of my generals even if theyre retiring if i had won i dont say well week even if we r dont say were week he should wear the least prepared i think he said in history maybe from ww almost like what difference does it make to hell of a long time but with the least prepared to have her ever and im saying even if its true dont say dont see why would the enemy why do we have to have that on television and then we had the other day showing how tough its going to be i see so many of these people on television you know there are certain words to describe whats happening with our country and i used to say were in competently led i gave up the wording company because its really not good enough whats the word we use bit so we have to be you know whats so important we have to be unpredictable but too predictable even these guys i get up before these debates and some of these oh and by the way debates ok look at it see the ball drop on top thats just because its my paper but on the bottom they have make america great again gop debate who won in the policies are all separate drug use an incredible guy drudge fortysix percent now you gotta send again people time magazine that was on the cover for weeks ago they do nothing for me believe me that they should have been many of the above right everyone says i dont say it i said theyll never pick me because im not establishment they played thank you ill be your man let you know i really want to be a year from now couple years from now when we want to straighten this mess out and then let him so time magazine / syracusecom usc news and world report pbs public broadcasting how people think oh these post because there are like to go to do immediately right they think im sitting by the phone calling in there getting a hundred thousand calls im not making that many calls im not going to spend that much money is not worth it so anyway pbs so i won the debate right washington times cbs fox las vegas and new jersey dot com think of it think of it i mean and then i go home and i watch these very very dishonest people well trouble is ok and he was ok not be the best night not his best night i said what i did you write you know how about bush where he makes a commercial you know hes trying to show hes tough tough trying to show his energy i said you doing better you keep going another years you know hes trying to show you how you make a commercial about me he spending millions and millions of dollars ok and yes me standing there and hes making his doing all the talking because when im ready to talk where every time i talked he got killed but where im ready to talk they dont have any talking so you will do this you will do that and dont forget to talk show they just had me standing there like this you remember when i talked i said wait a minute im at your two percent you started off over here next to me now you falling off the end of the stage of how dishonest thats actually dishonest advertising how do you do with the commercial where youre talking but he could have you talked i mean where everybody should i won the debate and by the way you know last in the debate came out i think it was bush he came in last in a bush bush or cases im not sure which one but one of them came out well i think those bush came out with one percent voted for it was just family his family now but and i dont think hes a bad person i really dont but we you know we can go by this anymore we gotta we gotta get this done we dont need we need people that really know what the hell did doing we need people we need people that are gonna take back our jobs from china from mexico from japan vietnam we need it so so but he might get a just cause i turned on im coming up today and i see the television and the saanich over and over and over again i keep look i dont even watch its myself i always watch things when im on right i cant even watch it anymore just turn it off its so boring but again hes saying i dont get a chance to answer so whats the purpose of an ad like that now most people saw the debate right so you know so i think it has no impact that a no you know i spent ten million or million or something on ads its going to be very interesting whats happening again get out of here is another one so the press here how it feels very dishonest people theyre very bad people some are fine but for the most part these are really sleaze bags these are bad people know that bad bad i go to stadiums we fill up stadiums and i tell the cameras to turn the cameras that they wont turn the campers they wont tell them they dont show how many people and all the time i say it my wife she said with the many people there tonight should we did you watch it i was like i said you didnt show it again and i dont turn the camp they want but if theres a protester one protester will stand up in a corner of the room or in a corner of the stadium and only time i actually like protesters cause the only time you see how many people are there is when theres a project for you know they focus on my face which i dont like i dont like that i wanted to see the crowd let the crowd better than my face and we all can i tell you right i love you too doll exactly how i wanted it so we had an interesting because you have a very dishonest newspaper reports also failing this paper is going down the two brewers i remember when this was a big paper look at the size of this thing is if they cut it down anymore you wont be able to find it it looks like the things you know when you go to the grocery store where they give you a little hand out what do they call that coupons so this guy his names joe mcquaid hes hes a low life im telling you heres what happened is what up ill tell you when so i thought he was hes useless i thought he was fine i thought he was an aggressive guy hed call me he talked to me hed want me to come up and make a speech in new hampshire i do it he asked me to help james foley which i like very much a given a big contribution to his parents as parents are great people he asked me to speak at that event i spoke at that event he asked me to do many many things she go through a whole litany of things then he said would you do me a big favor would you come to im gonna have a debate now debated before i never did get a job reduce i built jobs and put the great company and if i didnt do a great company wouldnt i wouldnt be talking im not a debate thats why im so impressive in winning all these debates but a lot of its common sense i mean lets face it right but im im a job producer ill be the greatest jobs president that god ever created that i could but this guy mcquaid edge and i go and i see hes doing very badly tells me the papers doing terribly which it is doing very badly hes gonna move out of his face or something but the building is like an empty building and its doing but i i dont care about this and then he calls me up very short time ago and he said would you do me a favor what cause i have million between facebook and twitter more than million people have a big following to put a month he said could you do me a favor chris christie is not on the big stage could you tweet that he should be i think it just now he may try and deny it but its awfully tough i didnt put it there from ill go check out i said you dont want me to do that i mean it sounds a little bit strange for me to sit be saying youre supposed to get on there by yourself right he said well id consider the favor i tweet it would be nice to have chris christie on the stage and i felt like a little weird people call me what you do thats why i said joe mcquaid from the figure ill get some better treatment right then he asked me for different things and then he asks me he said would you play a round of golf with me up in new hampshire at his course hes a member of a quick so i said i cant take that much time do not like president obama the guys out forever i just cant take that much time i said i cant spend the whole day playing golf i just cant do it he said would you would you then come and have lunch with me at this club nice club and very nice i said alright so i come up i made a speech i was with a group that wasnt so bad i didnt go over you have lunch and i meeting you know writing me all over the place hes not writing is walking me all over the place saying hello to different people this is trump this trip im not break im just saying hes having a good time right im sitting there i order hamburgers this is all about him were gonna hamburger i think he paid for the meal to be served all i can tell it he said well he didnt you look like you know what hit him i believe in hitting back to think so look at look at this lease with all of the things i do somebody is the big thing so hes doing a debate or has he calls it a forum and its like the night before facts and the facts they everybodys talking about it all over the world for months and its becoming bigger and bigger didnt used to be bigger than what i got involved it became right i mean variety all the hollywood things they should the truck debate that ok so number one i didnt really wanna come up here but i was young when i said joe i cant do it im not doing that i wrote another set of not doing it i dont feel good about doing it i dont know how it pertains and actually it was a disaster very few people went and got very very very low ratings almost nobody watched and bush had a bad night im not talking about it but he had a horrible night he shouldnt have done the debate was very bad for him but they did it because the union leader they figure has some power it used that power was run by the local family they did a great job but its lost its power i think i mean i dont know maybe it doesnt maybe it has more power than i think but i think you know i watch the sky and honestly is a loser so so so you want me to come up into the debate and i said i really dont think its appropriate and i school speak to the people at fox how would you feel if i went into it they werent exactly thrilled because they want to have the big first debate that i wanna have been debating and anyway i didnt do it i think i was the only one something by satellite i think i was the only way downtown is that would do well in iran has it worked out that way for them either but they did by satellite and it was over was that nobody cared and it was very again looked at the seats are a lot of empty seats in the auditorium and it was a disaster ok i should get credit for that vision they call that vision ok im the only one that didnt do the corporation just like vision was dont go into iraq even though youre strong in the military dont go directly to destabilize the middle east vision was writing about osama bin laden and in my book in nobody ever had a soso i wrote about osama bin laden joe scarborough a great post in the morning you know morning joe wright he talking about two years before the world trade center came to somebody should have gone out and gotten them and i wrote about because i would see him and i would read about him and he was a very threatening guy is this guy out but i wrote about him thats what you need ok but i should get credit for not doing the debate said into the debate he was really furious he was very very angry and i am a nice letter afterwards i said sorry i just cant and it probably means you wanted to ask me but i cant do it ok but in the meantime ive done all these things i made big contributions to charity i came up i made speeches with him i thought i get along with a friend and then what happens so tell me what happens he endorses christie and that was ok and i think that was going to happen because when he called me up couple of months ago to see if i can get christie onto the main stage i said i think is going to ask christy right why would he be doing that and the first time i met with him he said ill never endorse christie and the reason he said that he hated that christie embraced obamas so strongly before the election right before the election i happen to think i dont know if it cost him the election but it cost them a lot of oats and there are many people that think that that endorsement when obama went to new jersey that that endorsement was responsible for the loss of the republican party and romney i mean it it was certainly not good fact when i saw it right when i saw it i said i think hes going to vote for obama i actually called a friend of mine whos involved with him i said as he voted for obama i mean it was honestly was terrible was without the flood that barricade and obama went to new jersey and it was like he was like a little child christie was like he was so right now but he was so the only only in new hampshire only in so anyway but but its got spirit by the way youre ok ok i didnt i did not give her that i think its very cool but so i said he told me that i was terrible and i said i came out a long time ago when i first met you i think the first time i wait i said i really think that you know the one person i get outdoors is chris because he couldnt stand back that he did this anyway so why he did what he did is he endorsed christine thats trying i mean you can do it but he doesnt understand the starledger which is the big paper in new jersey said he was made a mistake there must be something wrong nobody called us youve had tremendous downgrades either nine or downgrades of the bugs its number of out of in terms of economic development and in terms of the economy its like one of the worst in the country for jobs its a disaster i have property in new jersey the taxes are through the roof they are through the roof and you go through it so you have obama i dont put my call it a hug mentally it was like it was unbelievable he was like a little boy oh im with the president memory flew in a helicopter he was all excited to be in the helicopter i said i would have put you in my helicopters much nicer no i thought it was a terrible thing ok so what else happened to george washington bridge now hes got three or four people there with him every day you a lot of you people you have companies your friends and you with the friends everyday right and your breakfast he would have lunch or breakfast with him all the time and dinner with this little group of you know his cabinet now the george washington bridge is the largest in the united states and is the most traveled on bridge i believe in the united states right they wanted as retribution for the mayor of fort lee new jersey they want to close it i dont know why because i think about the mayor of fort lee nobody even knows its in fort lee began to think about the governor of new jerseys doing a bad job but they close the bridge now you just put yourself in a commonsense mode you are with your cabinet you with him all the time theyre closing the biggest bridge in the united states most traveled on bridge one of them in the world and most traveled on the united states you doing that and youre not telling the governor and you with them all the time you think governor by the way theyre closing the george washington bridge tonight no no you having lunch and you dont happen to bring it up does anybody believe that honestly is there one person no no is there a chance and and im not you know i have been friends with christy but when mcquaid whos really christies lap dog i will tell you thats all it is first of all i know youre happy hes up here because hes up here but you know the people in new jersey want to throw out of office running new jersey where where a disaster state were going to have a governors up in new hampshire every single day having town hall meeting soon to be doing it in new jersey in all fairness ok i mean we love new hampshire but he shouldnt be up here all the time he supposed to be he supposed to be running the state so what happened what happens is mcquaid into asses chris said it was a really strange endorsement because again or nine out of nine down its the worst thing and i think that its an incredible circumstance so that was okay too but the starledger a whole big thing about how could they possibly do it and they said hes one of the worst governors in the history of the site how could they possibly do this endorsement how could they possibly do it they didnt understand it and they said they never even called us you dont normally get called the big newspaper thats a big newspaper in new jersey and it said what do you think well it was a strange thing ok so what happens is the following i think it thats ok but ive been really nice website i dont i can i get killed i get absolutely kill that i just got right up front page story about me a lot of the twenty said is really good tough tough tough and you know we need a little toughness now but diameter a dying paper and then again this was a big power here years ago although think of this in years since ok think that since nineteen eighty theyve picked one president was ronald reagan they endorsed one guy who ran and won for presents of a thirty sixyear period right theyve got one and then i can win this time that i can tell you okay i mean one thing ill say i one thing i say they didnt pick the guys gonna have been easy were gonna win right now so i just finished her story hello okay thank you you and the next day the next time it happened right now now the next the next time it happened i said be nice be really nice dont hurt please dont hurt em be nice the next said this trip is a much weaker person than we thought i cant wait so youre too tough for you to whatever but i will just tell you so i said theres no way because i did so much for this guy a sleaze bag theres no way youll say badly about me because you know i mean he actually told a big announcer that trump is a wonderful guy can you believe it that he writes just up so hes control and i just have to tell you to paper its not a good paper you know its dying i dont think its going to be in business more than two years he told me its doing its gotta move out of the building and the whole thing they let john and some other guys go that a fantastic people event is the greatest but i just wont tell you i think its a very disloyal act when youre nice to a person if we if we endorse christie i dont care i mean thats up to him but you dont go and try and hurt somebody thats been helping you and that really has done a good job ok you dont do that so here you can have a power thats all its worth garbage ok so we are going to make our country strong were gonna make it great what going to make it safe now what has happened and its interesting because i had a big boost in the polls as a now im at and the cnn and ima and morning consult and others and what happened is paris what happened is california where these radicalized people went wild and you know what i did i said we have to find out whats going on folks we have to find out whats going on this too much hatred this too much anger this too much killing we have to find out whats going on i mean we can continue to be nice and stupid and and just so often you know our countrys gonna go to hell mean we have these people coming in from syria when nobody knows anything about them they young a strong mostly men you look at this migration it looks like an army i mean you dont see many women you dont see many children you look at the man theyre not as strong as you by the way you looked stronger but you look at these mendes strong fit they look physically fit you actually say why are they back home fighting for their country you know what are they doing so were bringing them in and then you saw that have cell phones some of the many of them have cell phones and they have the isis flag on it ok they have i dont know if you saw that one and then you saw where theyve theyve come up with a counterfeiting of our passports did you see that where they actually have our passports and they have a printing machine now it is not stupid people we need smart people we need tough but we need smart tough is no good we need tough we need smart we need really smart because these are not stupid people so now they have our past but they make up in splits isnt that nice of them isis and then we take people in and we know sometimes there with isis and they come back and theyre fighting freshest trying to kill friends of us kill us eventually they just as they would have to go away for lets just do it at home and when you think about it we let them back into the country now we know there i said why are we letting them back in i gotta tell you one of the first thing im doing then that coming back in they go out a gun now terrible its terrible so when i started all my campaign was very much about economic development and were gonna stop with china who is just just absolutely ripping us after say that r is ripping like we have a trade imbalance we have a deficit with china almost five hundred billion dollars a year deaths in other words billion and then i hear people say free trade under freetrader people dont know but you want i want free trade but i want to be like smart rate likely to break even all even take breaking even but i dont want to lose five hundred and five billion dollars a year for the privilege of getting ripped off by china i dont want that its not going to happen thats not gonna happen with japan you know they send us their cars we have all by the way we have all the carts we have all the cards but we have people that dont have any idea about negotiation or or they bought off by the lobbyists and by the special interest groups i actually said nobody can be that incompetent you know some of these deals we make folks its not because theyre incompetent actually very competent for themselves but theyre not really incompetent they are lobbyists this special interests when somebody gives hillary you know ten million dollars and five million dollars are two million dollars and theyre on wall street and you know shes trying to go back a little bit shes trying to go to the left a little bit because shes got this wack job thats whack code named bernie sanders he was telling people well trouble and i have some of the same people i dont think theres too many bernie sanders well we have a few diff although he does agree that were getting ripped off and thats one thing ill say the one thing i hes very strong you know he deals with the problem is he cant do anything about the report he wont be able to do anything im really good at that stuff thats what i do but you know the one big thing he wants to double and triple you taxes and give everybody everything free and youre going to pay for it your taxes are gone through the roof we cant do it and im cutting your taxes down very very low you saw my tax plan would cutting business taxes down wood cutting all of them so i cant imagine this guy has a chance but i heard yesterday hes trying to get some my people and i said i dont know she talked about the same people that im talking about i dont think so so anyway what he wants to do massive massive massive tax increases and people dont talk about that and hillary clinton doesnt talk about it and the reason im talking about it i think you know im saying this and i really mean she does she does not mean it when she talks about it was it was so funny today where they actually abcs not wanting trump so badly but i will tell you and im telling you this strongly first of all she has committed a criminal act what she did with the emails is criminal according to every single person that ive met and knows his stuff and and not just in one day and benghazi also on the benghazi was different benghazi she was too lazy to answer phone calls remember a commercial about the phone ring it just watch even answer if she did you see where the ambassador since seven hundred or five hundred calls and emails everything and yet she spoke to a friend many times but they had they said they were in trouble and many many emails were coming she never responded and remember that commercial is a pretty famous commercial who do you trust tonight obviously didnt trust her because obama her obama i want to find a way that word thats a common word of the enemies to be beaten badly i will give the president and by the way all show npr ok national public radio one of the most revered mcs political people one of the most revered used it and he is the exact same where even the edf en to him it was ok for drug was horrible but what it means is to be beaten badly and thats what i guess it has other meanings but it means and when i met is to be beaten badly i wont use it again today we dont want to make that the store we want to make other things the story but but but if you look at whats going on and you see whats happening we have all of the power economically we have tremendous power because china remember this its one of the greatest chefs in the history of the world what china has done to our country one of the greatest steps if you look at what mexico is doing good country its a mini version of what john has i mean and you people know better because you know all the jobs went down to mexico you know practically better than anybody cuz they came right in new hampshire they came out of new england and you have suffered because of crazy policies and it doesnt and it doesnt help us so with mexico we have the wall we have the butcher we gonna do everything right they dont respect us more by doing that they had a respect us more by doing what were going to do i tell the story with boordas everybody know that the forts and just simple they gonna bill again and its such a great story because its so simple but forged it has been two and a half billion dollars building a plant to mexico so that means you get close different plants mostly in michigan i guess and how does it help us and then we take their cars trucks and parts no tax no nothing like people that dont know what theyre doing they just drive them but you know next thing that could have the illegals driving right across the board modest well if hillary gets in thats whats going to happen for buildings plan and the illegals will drive the cars right in and theyll probably give him the car to you know they wont give them they wont give them to our vet but the given to the illegal so i tell you know so i said thats not going to happen and i kill the serb just doing an abbreviated caused a lot of you heard it but a lot of people didnt hear but its so good two and a half billion dollars for spending and it do it spending it in mexico by the way nabisco now its closing its big plant in chicago and then moving it to mexico y when never gonna have an oreo right no more no more oreos know which is a good thing not a bad thing thats good in a lot of different ways but so with ford so they could do they could send the question is what happens when hillary gets call and she knows i mean to sound stupid people she does us no good for our country but her lobbyists and special interests are all getting paid by different companies including ford and various and they gonna say you cant just super pacs to cricket super pacs how crooked of those super pacs man they are bad news they are so crooked their bad news we had super pac setup for trump i didnt even know who the hell do people were you see people on television one of them did the art of the deal pack nicelooking young guys i told fox shooting it to view it look like i dont know what they gonna do with the money people to send the money i have no idea what theyre going to do i mean some of the candidates have their super pacs no running their campaigns theyve given up but the super pacs are running and i think its i guess its not correct theyre not supposed to be doing it i guess you could say its illegal but youre not supposed to be doing it but these super pacs are out of control so with for it so forth has this plant and hillary lets say finds out and she said what i wanted i dont wanna dont wanna and then hell be called by one of our donors by special interest lobbies and so we gave you five million dollars you cant do that that would be very disloyal etcetera and bottom line is they will fold hundredpercent like a hundred percent with me i dont think any of their money i have turned down so much money it sickens me to think of it as my whole life now my whole life has been taking money thats what i do with business people take money take take take some people said he plays too tough game we need somebodys gotta play we play we do it its a game i you know to certain point and now i want to put that whatever that is i want to put it to use so that we get rid of some of the nineteen trillion which by the way its going to trillion and did you see what was past two weeks ago wont happen here we are you know ok so were disappointed democrats im more disappointed the republicans that the republicans let that get past the visas the syrians also funded the everything the border coming through everything is funded everything is funded that is one of the most disgraceful things ive seen and it took what hours it was like done you know these republicans are going to go down im going public at some of the likely cause i tell the truth theyre going to go down to washington and they raised their hand against obamacare didnt do it they were gonna kill obamacare they didnt do it you learn how to judge it should have done it judge roberts he didnt do it they didnt do it he had two chances to do it first time hundredpercent second time would have made it so would have gone its gonna go anyway heres the good news is going anyway but its going to be very now its going you know the beautiful thing about if i run and if i win so i run and i said this before i just said if i run and if i win ill be able to undo his horrible rules and regulations that have been crippling our businesses you see i hope so because im working my ass off this guy this beautiful young guy hes not going to be voting for another years but ill tell you what i appreciated his daddy make america great again i appreciate it now but i am working and working really hard and frankly im doing it because i wanna put i always had a talent at getting things good and ive had a talent that money and we need it we have to have a talent and i made the statement about a month ago i said we want to make our country rich again and then were gonna make a gradient and a woman came up as you said mr trump that sounds recruit to say we gotta make it rich we can make a debtor nation right now where a third world nation if you look at our school system where position we spend the most per student by far second is so far behind us and were number in the world in schools ok and by the way common core guy on guy comment cards second amendment yes were keeping second amendment you know obama is looking to do in my opinion an executive order on the second amendment i think hes looking cuz he cant get the support and i think i think thats gonna be a prob that could be a tough one for him i think hes gonna try and do a second does some kind of an executive order in the second amendment just based on what im feeling and what im saying and ill tell you thats gonna be a rough one because theres nobody more impassioned than the people that believe strongly in the second amendment tell you about the second amendment if in california or in paris frankly i mean were not talking second embarrassed but when these animals came in then they started shooting into various places in paris if we had a couple of people like you and like a couple of people two or three you guys definitely you guys they wouldve gotten off the first shot this guy they woulda got the first shot but you know what it was a bit paris and france have the toughest gun laws in the world they say nobody is going to accept the biggest ok so they walked in with ak fortysevens a walk in with all this stuff and you know they havent they bring it is not so hard to get it in if you dont mind breaking the law they were the only ones with any weapons and they had big weapons big weapons powerful weapons hundred and thirty people dead many world war gonna die you know yet people that are hanging by a thread in hospital and they were just shooting people randomly and then the press close to guide the head guy with a dirty had caused him a message of mine and ive been hitting them so hard at it dont call me mister man because they are playing the internet better than we do you know we are the we we invented the internet they played better than we do they radicalized people over the internet so i said to him i said look dont call the press dont call me mr mine and ive been saying that for three weeks and i dont hear anyone i said hes a lowclass sleaze bag who happens to be dead right now and i called the guy with the dirty had ok because thats a good expression and they go in and they go in they go in and they should people now if one of you folks had a gun strapped to your waist or spit on your ankle strapped out to your ankle and you could say look at that thats not good and they received a little fire would have been people hurt but it would have been a very small number by compassion and i know one thing they will they would be gone that would be done but we dont have that and when you think about it same thing in california they walk into a room with no guns no anything innocent people that if they were friends these people through them like an anniversary party or something i mean this is a sickness going there is a sick this cut this radicalization is very this is real sickness doubt i say its a sickness thats not nice its kind of folks this something wrong we gotta find out whats going wrong this something really bad happening this something bad so they go into shoot all those people people dead others going to die and they should now if a couple of people have guns in that room it would have been that way it would have been that way even a you need to have everybody if a few of the people had guns it wouldnt have been that way and you could say that for every about the army base with a sick soldiers were killed and two of them were like worldclass i mean these are top of the line shoulders one of the boys worldclass marksmen and they had a gun free zone on a military base you believe it first thing ill do first thing ill do we take care of our vets were gonna take care of our police because the police have been mistreated terribly and we are gonna and gunfree zones on military bases and scott and day one thatll end day one that thats an executive order of i ever saw one thats gonna and a one so when im with friends from new york liberal you know they say well were going well and then i go into pairs i said ok lets assume that were paris and the shooting this and everybody standing there like how pleased and missing you overhear book you is what was happening come over here boom boom boom nobody could do anything nobody could do anything they were they were helpless it was horrible when you hear the stories it was horrible i explained that these guys these people that want to knock out the second amendment theyve moved the debate so badly that they embarrass anyone to talk as if its in front of people didnt talk about it lets go to a different subject sailors in the next day or so if you change in my no no they dont change your mind and im not even saying that but people there something going on there theres something wrong but we are going to have a strong second amendment we are going to keep it were not going to let him play with the bullets you know they want to take away the bullets that one of the concepts you know because it doesnt necessarily talk about bullet so they want to take away your ammunition were gonna have a strong second amendment were gonna have it and its better for the country its strong its good i have two young sons hunters they are theyve been the nra for so long so my butt but theyve been there for so long and you know hillary wants to take away your guns that is such a bad thing she wants to take away your guns folks and i i tell you what you know they say the republicans have a structural problem we do its harder for a republican to and we have a strip certain structural problems but they what when you talk about the guns when you talk about the common core when you talk about different things that we have we have some big advantages over them we really have some big big advantages but the guns are going to be safe another thing thats going to be safe is this great state so i want to tell you its gonna be as good as i said its going to be and im telling you its going to be in you know whats going on and its going in and lots of circles where they want to and i dont know why but they want to do something bad to new hampshire its not gonna happen if i went that i can tell you i give you my word never gonna have never gonna so i just want to finish by by saying that were gonna be strong were gonna be smart but we have to be unpredictable so ill go to these debates and i have some of these people some are excellent in summer i will please you know you know the ones im talking about real sleaze mr trump what do you think of this that that is that thats not like a question thats a statement we know who they are but you know what i say to him and i say it strongly i say we have to be unpredictable theyre saying what would you do with that i was going to bomb the hell out of the ul but i had to say it eventually thats one problem i had to say it and now people are saying ive been saying it for years but i dont want to say everything i wanna be unpredictable i wanna be general pat down wanna be general douglas macarthur we want to go in we dont want them to know what the hell were doing we have to go in and a lot of people love it when i say that you know its its the kind of thing and the kind of thing and then the and then the mcs again announcing and say well he didnt know that i dunno i knew so much remember osama bin laden in my book remember mom the oil for years ive been saying it but i said bombing keeping ok this is different because i wanted to give a lot of the money to the vets and the families of the vet said were work ill and to the wounded warriors i mean these are the greatest people the way they go through life and a big smile on that face i wanted to give plenty and we have so much left would have so much but i want to keep it but look were going to do something im so happy i did this i really was torn i said to my wife i said to my wife on june thank you i appreciate i appreciate but i said to my wife i said boy and it dropped out i went down the famous escalator were she was elegant and i was waving and and its a pretty famous scene now and we went right from day one we hit it on the head and we took a lot of heat and a lot of abuse and everyones now coming back same thing with the muslim situation i get a lot of heat to three days he said people dont you know maybe hes right now theyre all talking about somebody had to bring it up and ill tell you what if i dont bring it up would have never been brought up ok and we have muslims a wonderful we have one wonderful people but theres something going on there they have to turn in like trenches these people in california people know we had bombs all over the floor people know why did they turn them in turn them in because its their culture there around each other they see each other they know whats going to get a tournament you cant have people dying you cant let this happen so i brought it up when i brought in about illegal immigration you wouldnt even have that as a topic if i didnt bring it and nobody was even talking about it and it turns out to be a very big so i i just finished by saying this its so important that on february eighth ninth you what you should do in february stand there is you know what youre gonna have you can have tremendous you have tremendous numbers of those problems but its so important that you get there early and are troubling night you get in and vote its so important because you know otherwise its just all a big waste of time i got a call from one of the most prominent reporters and very highly respected and he said to me who i dont know but hes one of the most probably one of the most respected in the world actually and i took his call and he said how does it feel i said has what feel he said what youve done nobody else has ever ever done in the history of policy and and even the other day as cnn said number one story from nbc said number one story so many other number one search trumpedup ok thats fine but you know what he said how does it feel like i said i dont know what you read he said what youve done i did look what ive done doesnt mean anything if i dont want it does to me to me i really does it they said no and he said no no it doesnt matter if you win or lose what youve done is youve changed the whole dialogue youve changed everything youve changed politics as we know it and i want to know how you feel i say i will let you know after i went because honestly unless i win it doesnt mean a damn thing to me i can tell you that i could graduate so youll get one of these youll get one of these other candidate up here and they have thirty people forty people people its true i see it we had a thing where we had four thousand five hundred people in new hampshire and bush was down the road meaning like miles down the road you know its new hampshire so long way but thirty miles down the road and hit a hundred and nine people we had for people this is a movement this is a an unbelievable thing is happening i dont even use the term silent majority because there really a noisy group of people they want and and to a large extent this is true the american dream is dead but im gonna make it bigger and stronger more powerful more beautiful than ever more beautiful and just to finish we are going to make america great again i love you i love you thank you everybody i love you get out and vote the night thank you thank you thank you everybodytalking to somebody that i talked to report a good report and i said i dont think you know for all of the selffunding i dont think people even understand it i dont think that most people appreciate the fact im the only one democrat or republican that sell funds right and im saying i dont know if its appreciated i dont know cuz it seems to be but i cant tell you cuz i was on the other side of the spectrum for a long time and i gave a lot of money over the years to politicians the bloodsuckers i call it i gave a lot i gave a lot of money over the years i gave recycled three hundred and fifty thousand to the republican governors association i gave money to everyone and by the way as a business person especially from the standpoint of countrywide worldwide to give to everybody you want everybody to love you you always do that you have to have an obligation to your company your employees to your family to everybody but i just wonder self funding right it does matter doesnt it doesnt it i think cause i never understood whether or not the people really understand it whether or not the people that do really get it because i want to tell you when you looking to pass legislation or oil or drugs or something and ill tell you a story that i heard recently a friend of mine came up and hes in the pharmaceutical business and he said to me and very successful guy he said to be donald terrible thing happens when the united states which is the largest buyer of drugs meaning drugs to make people better prescription drugs etcetera everything they dont negotiate the price so even if the largest buyer in the world but they dont negotiate the price they buy things almost as though you went to your local drugstore and took it off the shelf thats the price and they said how is that possible no i immediately knew why but if it were that way if we did negotiate lets say we did a favorite nations laws ok meeting the person that buys whatever drug for the lowest price during that year thats the price the united states will pay ok now we should pay less but at least it if we do that will save about three hundred billion dollars though can you believe that no can you believe that one so you talk about medicare you talking about all those different you know they say we cant do this weekend to that somebody said why is it now i was even surprised at that and im a pretty skeptical guy when it comes to politics and politicians cause i know politicians better than anybody in the world those but somebody said well donalds not experience i said to experience ive been dealing with these guys all my life i know so they said how is it possible that something like that could happen how is it possible version of the drug companies are massive donors to the politicians so if you look at johnson and johnson and you look at these different companies they give to the politicians so why do the politicians do no no you cant negotiate you have to pay effectively you have to pay retail its so simple that will end on day one ok that was formed a terrible its terrible you know government spending people talk about budgets to politicians it took about budgets so government spending billions and billions and billions of dollars can be cut in hours and hours yes it down folks relax were gonna be here for ill be here so i by the way i came in so we came in i landed we drove here from the airport you have the most beautiful churches ive seen i mean these churches seriously no the churches there were three of four they were so beautiful so i almost want to just go in and pray but i figured id be late and you would like that ok but you have honestly the most beautiful churches coming in speaking of that christianity as you know is under siege its under seige were not going to let it happen were not gonna be i would like a letter that you know ive been telling people were going to start saying merry christmas again a christmas were gonna start saying it was shot undersea you know what happened and i was with pastors and ministers resettle and a whole group there a lot of endorsements with the evangelicals im leading nationwide in the polls and people say wow donald they dont know they dont understand people people dont understand i have an unbelievable relationship jerry falwell junior just endorse me which was a great endorsement pastor jeff francis lewis is a great guy pass to jeffery said so many but were leaving with a weird number one with evangelicals and they they want to have somebody thats going to protect the country they want to have somebody thats gonna make great trade deals they want to have somebody thats gonna get rid of obamacare and do something we have so many alternatives i dont know if youve seen whats happened some of you have because people come up to me that dropping at el even have lost a fortune its going to die in seventeen anyway unless the republicans continue to extend didnt read it money but people are going up percent with the premiums going up and look at whats happening theyre not getting denied getting coverage of not getting proper care i mean its so bad its so bad its not working if you are run over by a truck you probably wont be able to use your insurance so were gonna get rid of it would replace it with something thats going to be great but what happened what happened with the churchs what happened with the churchs is president johnson put in a bill that really has everybody nervous because it makes them a political entity they lose their taxexempt status so they actually have less power than the people sitting here because that doesnt happen to us and i said how could you let it happen the church has such incredible power in this country if they used it if theyve been together but they dont band together and im pretty sure im pretty sure they dont ban together because theyre afraid to lose their taxexempt status and i said to him recently had fifty ministers come up and pastors come up to my office and we sat around talked for two hours was amazingly so interesting i have such tremendous support with msa folks you have probably two hundred and fifty million you have a bigger lobby than women and you have a bigger lobby than men thats not bad right i said and you dont have real power if i would have said what i said which a lot of people respect and i said with respect when i talked about radical islamic terrorism and people respected we have a president that wont use the term you wont talk about it you never going to solve the problem unless you talk about it but if i would have said that talking about the muslims if i would have said the same things about christians i wouldnt have the same approach hard to believe the whole thing is ridiculous we had a pick up a couple of you might remember that a couple of months ago because things are going gone and i talked temporary but things are going on there are bad this hatred that nobodys ever seen anything like this when you fly planes into the world trade center you fly planes into the pentagon the third plane i have to tell you these were brave people they took it down probably heading to the white house they think but theres an anger out there when you look at paris and you have these thugs walk in and kill a hundred and thirty people with many many people in hospitals that are so gravely injured many more will die when you look at california few weeks ago with the radicalized couple they say she radicalized him who cares what do these people come from nowhere do they come from where do they come from and then president obama yesterday goes to a mosque and he apologizes i mean what whats going on we have to write not only goes in and he apologizes and you know its all fine but we have to find out whats going on when we have the migration and you look at this and its very sad and we should build safe centers we should build safe zones in syria but we have a migration and you look and you see so many young strong men and they say where the women and the children are you have but you have in disproportionately small numbers and then you have a president wants to take him in by the thousands and we are know where they come from who they are it may be a trojan horse it maybe isis nobody knows ok nobody knows and were taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people and the real numbers are far greater than the number you talking about and you know what we all have hearts we wanted to be good i want to build safe zones i wanna have to me let that let somebody else pay for it for change the gulf states are making a fortune right saudi arabia before the oil went down now theyre making a little bit less abf they were making a billion dollars a day to give it a billion dollars a day and we pay for everything we protection arabia we protect so many countries you know we protect your money nobody knows we protect japan japan has a treaty with us if we get attacked they dont have to do anything if they get attacked we have to start world war three ok this way now all ideals we dont make good deals we dont win anymore we dont win we never have occurred when was the last time we had a victory so we take he said ww thats actually pretty remember who said that said up stand up weve had some but we havent had many we certainly dont have many victories anymore well thats good you better vote for me speaking of that you will you please get out you gotta vote its going to be a biggie i tell you this you wont you wont be sorry think of this picketers so we protect south korea we have soldiers right now on the line between north and south korea we have the maniac over there you know talking about nuclear nuclear every time he raises his head we start sending our ships over now i like south of buildings in south korea i do great with so many many people like i like china but they kill us okay because the leaders are much smarter than our leaders but we have the greatest businesspeople in the way we just dont use it we used political hacks but south korea take it wiews political action negotiated deals its unbelievable all talk no action these guys know i like the weather held his group is out like this group so we have soldiers we protect south korea every time i ordered a huge amounts of television sets a different judge thousands and thousands again from south korea it is a absolute behemoth they make a fortune why are we doing this i want to do it i want to protect them but were a debtor nation we are nineteen trillion dollars trillion nobody even knows what the hell the word treated means if i asked even the smart how many millions are in the chilean how many hundred millions of how many billions is it a trillion its so out of control people dont even know even the top smartest people that arent even know we are trillion dollars we have now with that stupid budget deal that was approved three weeks ago that gotta prove so fast by the republicans it got approved how long did it take half a day so we have a budget deal you know we send these people to washington they shoud tough were gonna fight obamacare were gonna fight for this weekend to fight for that with it take care of our vets which nobody cares about sept from we gotta take care we send them to washington they gonna take care of the vet figure to do all these things they get there and something happened so they look at the beautiful i always say they look at those beautiful marble columns they look at the florence a look at the angels in the ceiling and they say to the husband and the wife darling we finally made it were never leaving and then they say are you voting for obama care and they go yes some voted for obamacare its crazy something happens some things in the water in washingtondc something happened but is that really disappointing ok so here it is so you have this man on the to the right to the right now in to the right of the differences but you have this band has a maniac perhaps and you gotta give him credit for one thing that guys a young guy hes dealing with these generals his father dies and he maintains control something going that you know when they dont underestimate a guy like that do not underestimate right does everyone know what i mean theres plenty of guys i assume want to take control the father dies two kids young kid takes over do not underestimate that kind of talent now theyll say all i like it i dont like him at all just dont underestimate vladimir putin said the other day donald trump is a genius hes the leader and hes going to be the leader in the united states he made a statement these people are running against the republicans said thats terrible that he said that you have to denounce that statement denounce it immediately you have to do an out i said you think im going to denounce a fact that i guys calling me like great energy im gonna do thats crazy are you crazy with us what you know i love you too man even though its a guy but i love whoever the hell who is that i like that guy so now but wouldnt it be nice seriously i read the other day with the military is having a hard time buying bombs because this so unbelievably expensive probably they do the same thing is with the drugs out whatever it is will pay right because again the defense contractors are big contributors right i havent even started this folks believe me i figured out like at about two seconds think of it they cant get the bombs again get the missiles because theyre so expensive so wouldnt it be nice if we can use rice and they use some of their bombs and then this is we have to pay for it so thats whats going to happen thats whats going to happen i think well get along fine i think well get along fine and we have to stop being the policemen for the entire world most of which hates her guts hey i got i mean you think about it look what we did we going to iraq which by the way yet how saddam hussein this was not a nice guy but he had one thing that he really liked doing he killed terrorists ok he killed terrorists and he didnt have weapons of mass destruction by the way in case anybody doesnt know so we go in and i said youre somebody said jeb bush said nice light on the chopping off its low energies theyre chopping off the heads of christians in the middle east and many other people and were supposed to have a nice tone ok were supposed to have a wonderful town well ladies and gentlemen is that nice the world is an evil place you have to understand the world is tough right now this is like medieval times you know when we read about medieval times is to jump ahead i heard of chopping off heads until recently james james foley remember james a great beautiful james foley with his parents are great people but they started chopping off heads we do here deserve these are people that are animals and we gotta ended we gotta knock the hell out of them and fast fast so we have to stop saddam hussein shown that area jobproducing i do great job they do really good stuff i have a great statement did a wonderful job when i put in my papers everyone went crazy they were

over people today and look at the people still pouring in its crazy folks its a movement im telling you this isnt like you know other guys come here are the candidates come here theres like a hundred and twelve people fiftynine people i mean jeb bushs spent a hundred and twelve million dollars and nobody shows up wat the house and he spent a lot of it on negative ads on me and he goes ahead after editor at a shell and i hope people dont think so and then it goes up he does negative ads we have something special happening theres a movement going on were going to take our country back thats what were going to do and were gonna run our country intelligence intelligence and were actually going to have because you know a lot of people left when i say but i did it im a unifier i bring people together we have a president whos a divider hes a very divisive person i am a unified we are gonna bring people together this country is totally disjointed everybody hates everybody and people shouldnt be surprised at usc our country is going to come together we have a movement going on that hasnt been seen it was on the cover of time magazine last week great sorry right great story written by somebody that never called me he never called me i should i finally found out how to handle the press dont speak to him was when i talk to my get lousy stories all the time its incredible but if i dont this guys a great writer he has eroded pressure but he is hes known as a brilliant writer and you should get it the one last week he talked about the fact that we have something going on that hasnt happened in this country in many many years and some people say its never happened in the country theres never been anything like this i go to dallas we have a stadium like this we have people with the mavericks play i go to mobile alabama alabama right right they do have a good football team right now i have to admit we have to be true we can respect somebody we can respect the stuff but now but i got a mobile alabama we have people we go twice now to oklahoma people all of new hampshire we have the biggest crash the biggest crowds all over it no matter where we go we have the biggest crowds and theres something there is something happening well she said you cant stop you can stop you know how we can stop if they dont vote if we have people to question is do people get up and vote you know so weird thing they stand outside for five hours to come in and the only question because now were going to see you know without the caucus stuff and i think we did great in iowa you know i really do i think we did i think the people of iowa tremendous we had an amazing time there and i really you know a lot of people said dont go to iowa skip iowa started new hampshire new hampshire doing really well but started to have said no but i like i when i like two people have a lot of friends that live in my window will go to and i think we should come in first to be honest with you a lot of things happen theyre not the things happen a lot of things happened there but is it funny i came in a strong strong second third was quite a distance away although they said about marco who is he was so close class is over votes which you know were not talking about use numbers two things happened number largest vote in the history of iowa that the republicans write the number largest which ad i got other than the one who is a double candidate you know has two candidates for one i got the largest vote outside of the one candidate i got the largest ever in the history of it you know so i and ive never done this before im not a politician show but thank you thank you so the person that came in third unbelievable result unbelievable is a huge victory but i came in second in the should do so well as they can but you see i dont think i did come in second i think i came in first ok but but i honestly it doesnt matter get a lot of delegates at it really doesnt matter because my total focus now is our new hampshire and then next week my total focus is going to be right here in south carolina so we are going to create borders this country has people coming in and a lot of the wrong and i just saw this statistic today it came in yesterday in congress a hundred and seventy nine thousand you know that is thats like yankee stadium filled up three or four times a hundred and seventy nine thousand huge criminal aliens right these are people that were convicted of a crime ok convicted some of them very serious crimes we have them now in our country we dont even send them out were gonna get about now were gonna get about and were gonna send it back where they came from when i put them in jail for forty years for years and years in jail its expensive strong borders are border patrol people are fantastic and were going to build a wall ok remember were going to build a wall i always gonna kick his ass are you ready and who is going to pay for the wall so easy and so easy you know we have a trade deficit with mexico thats so you its so big or as donald trump would say its so huge it is so massive and again these politicians im not gonna reveal a lot of i really like all but they never gonna get you to the promised land folks none of them i know him all that is not their thing its not that they so they come up to me you cant build a wall really cant you well you know thats how easy its so easy i know exactly what is going to look like its so easy china has a wall of this bill two thousand years ago thats miles law thats a walk now that id say maybe we dont bill thats like going across the united sates somebodys gonna build a wall in northern border well thats a pretty big law about four times that china the great wall of china miles long can you imagine that they built a two thousand years ago wall thats a big wad id see that this is serious wall this is not a wall that they drive the jeeps across with the ramp so you know we have little walls are like this i like four children they actually do they built rafts down its easier but theyve built in this pictures in the magazine short i think it time magazine a jeep loaded up with drugs goes up down sell the drugs she does goes to new hampshire without a huge problem they have a huge problem you have a huge everybody in the country is used to go up to go down they come back so we get the drugs that they get the cash no good not gonna happen anymore not gonna happen anymore not gonna happen portly we have people so addicted because you get into the heroin and its cheap and theyre so addicted and getting out of it getting out of that addiction is a tremendous trouble that help people have to help people but the best way to stop the best way is if they dont start and if they cant get it either way to make it so tough were gonna make it so but these politicians come up to me and the politicians and they said to me seriously how you look at it get mexico to pay and they always say they say youre not gonna be able to get mexico to pay how he didnt do that and i say its easy the deficit is hoping they make so much money we give them a lot of money on top of everything else which is hard to believe we give them a lot of money we have searched the world is peanuts compared to the numbers you talking about i didnt know that these people these are not people that are gonna get you there so carl icahn endorsements a great businessman many other great businessman endorse me and they want to be involved they dont want money they dont want to have you know then that political hes a great people hes a great now some nice nice where the hell cares right now we can some you wouldnt want to go to dinner with you and the beautiful red sweater you wouldnt want any part of ammo though theyre so rich i dont know that your husband there now you know the guy next to you then you probably wouldnt mind dinner with a guy whos worth billion though who knows but we have the greatest business people in the world we dont use we use his political hacks people they gave contributions to get jobs we as people that have no talent we use people that actually have conflicts of interest when they negotiate they like china they have deals i mean we are the worst we are led by people that are stupid we are led by people that are incompetent we cant keep going we cant keep going you know every year the trillion trillion you know at what point does it stop and you know i said to the politicians who said we have a plan on the budget they were telling me they think they can balance the budget over the next years i said years thats a long time years and it took about ok so were gonna make our country so strong we can build up our military you know its very depleted general and very very depleted and it has to be because last quarter we are now just practically no growth we would essentially no growth you know what china announces growth we we havent had seven percent growth in many many years what china and now just growth its like a catastrophe for china we have no gross i last quarter no growth think that what that means that means ha rochelle our exports this month and last couple of months i now negative they went way down lowest since the recession which means one thing you can have a big recession its coming within a bubble ugly ugly bubble and you see it now with the stock market starting to happen because the only good sign the self is is nonsense the the unemployment rate because if youre looking for a job and you try so hard and you go here and i cant find it ok so now you go and you quit you just cant do it anymore chance i just bought places i get to see you give up you are statistically considered employed in other words you are now taking off thats why they give these phony numbers the real unemployment rate is over and ill tell you something if it were really like this it is which is a number devised by the politicians to make them look at before obama long before ababa they should look at hey if i win its gonna make me look great but you know what its a number devised because they dont count people that look for jobs and cant find them then i cannot get how can you not counting heads of millions of people that cant find jobs i will tell you if that number will correct we wouldnt have a stadium like this full of people right we wouldnt have it wouldnt be it wouldnt be so it wouldnt be i talked about the way we deal i talked about all of the things we do we have to use examples and you know what you dont have to use lots of different examples i cant but there are some that are so egregious sergeant pergola trader right is treasurer is a dirty rotten trader by the way so side yet hes a traitor he left he walked he thought it was gonna have a wonderful life you know celebrating whatever they celebrate so he lives we lose six people killed great young beautiful soldiers i see their parents great beautiful soldiers get killed they go out and they look at and theyre looking at they get killed probably viciously killed it right we get back yeah we had a general and a colonel and they were interviewing everybody they knew he was a traitor it wasnt like oh they made a mistake and i you can see that you would like that how can you be that stupid but this is far worse we knew he was a traitor so far deles we get bergdahl and they get five killings that theyve cut it that theyve wanted for nine years and that now all out back on the battlefield tried to kill us all what kind of a deal is this what kind of people what kind of people would make a deal like this the other is why i talk about it all the time because its almost that even understandable its so ridiculous the deal with iran we give them one hundred and fifty billion dollars we get nothing we havent negotiated named john kerry as secretary of state now shell show said i talked about every time i talk i dont even believe it could be possible and he doesnt ever walk from the negotiation hes got a negotiation he doesnt walk from the guy they are dancing in the streets all over around at the great deal that burning the american flag this saying how stupid we are because it feels so good at the deal has been made yet that was six months ago remember theyre all dancing i said this still doesnt make it right who the hell would go back in just keep negotiating like nothings happening and you have as obama calls him the supreme leader i will never call him the supreme leader fox you have a year obama we have spoken to the supreme leader that is i always set of children we serve as i thought of you have a deal where they get a hundred and fifty billion did you see what they spent all that money in europe and with russia and with other countries everybody but us they bought a hundred at eighteen airbuss right hundred at a cape not boeing airbus faded europe they bought missiles from russia then negotiating with italy then negotiating with everybody but the united states shipper united states what are we doing and then carried two weeks ago says yes we expect some of that money will be used to terror but we havent been able to see it yet if he thinks terror what the hell does he give you the money right did you see that two weeks ago hes talking about yes we expect some of the money will be used for terror is this man a dumbing or why what were doing now that deal and ice ages we should never ever have given them that money that we should never have started that negotiation unless we had our prisoners back ever and what you do just you know pretty simple is like any one of these people that im talking about that will be negotiate would have said this stances i would say what you do is you go and you said we need our prisoners back years ago did you see it youll take so long what forever you know why they just kept saying no no no we just kept saying okay okay okay anyway the deal went like three years four years i never saw deal takes so long and we never walk we never once walked out of the room i said boy would this be a good time to a because so often it was so bad and you saw what was happening as it was being covered by the media and you saw what was happening at lyk it would make obama look so good if they actually got up and walked right lieutenant governor what a great guy by the way a lot of great what a family water family the bush of the family we stand up this is a great woman this is the real boss right here looked great couple great people really greatly appreciate how do you like his commercial did you hear it that everybody here it pretty not that many people heard whats going on did people here the commercial i think its great i told him i said henry i actually move my voice kisses said i endorses commercial you have to say that as a matter of life and i did like my voice compared to his voices voices so beautiful i said do me a favor moving to the front that said the back i did like but with your ndo what happens is you go in and you say gotta have the prices theyll say no you leave the desperate they need money their economies gresham its a disaster over there or it was now theyre rich as hell he said we need to get out of our personnel say no you walk out you say bye bye enjoy your crashed economy enjoy your depression enjoy your depression funk theyll call within i always say hours but i usually mean hours they usually me two hours but we dont even get on the plane and they say you have here prisoners lender prisoners land you go in four seconds right and seconds are the following folks you know my father as you say take the lumps and he thought i was too full he had a son that his highenergy had a son highenergy as opposed to chip now my father used to say the sun set to tough so you know i would say youre not getting the money should tough right you know you force them to do things its not good so i would have said the follow alice you got a problem we r trillion dollars we have another two trillion because we had it its approved budgets that it dont know what to do it so were trillion we dont have the money we dont have it theres nothing we can do about it we wont be able to give you the hundred and fifty billion dollars theyll go nuts but within days later that tobacco now we saved a hundred and fifty billion dollars its easy now we get down to negotiate we make a deal ok cuz i love the idea of making deals on nuclear nuclear is very important we have to do something with nuclear nuclear is a whole day crazy deal and we have to and we have to be very vigilant and we have to be very careful and we have to make sure that the wrong people dont get and if we think somebodys got it we gotta really act we cant just havent noticed like a north korea they talk about iran now an offer to surrender and doesnt have no clear they will after this they dont even have to make it they can buy it for all the money they have but they dont have but the guy in krajena have something like like homework its so unpleasant you dont want to think about it well given notice we never talk about north korea hes actually got to clear we dont talk to know why they dont talk china has to take care of that problem and if china doesnt take care of that problem we have to hurt them on trade because they suck so much money out of us system they suck our jobs they take so much i love to chinese too great friends of mine i make a fortune with i tell people the largest bank in the world as a tenant the mine in manhattan its from china i sell condominiums hands of millions of dollars to the chinese the grade but like the mexico leaders like the japanese leaders the chinese leaders are too smart for up people that just watch for leaders are leaders dont have a clue they dont even have a clue they devalue their currency ill it is like the new trade deal where they dont even talk about devaluation thats the number one thing they do and its not even discuss thats why im so against the new trade deal and watch china which is it a part of the trade deal will come in at a later date through the back door and theyll take advantage of us like they always do because we have people that are not the right people negotiating ideals just like when we had carry and these clowns at negotiated a deal with iran so what we have is we have a deal now where they get the money where they have days for inspection so in other words we call up we think that we want to inspect because we hear missiles are being built in a certain area so they have days but the clock doesnt start kicking you have to go through a whole process so the days could be much much longer but the greatest is where they have his own with a self inspect the shelf inspected think of it we call up as president obama would say we call up the supreme leader supreme leader sir sir obama sure i hear youre making missiles would you please selfrespect and let us know whether or not theres any nuclear being made on that pleased ala so what you please tell us whether or not as any nuclear being made in that area and yes you know in our agreement you will self inspect oh yes will call you back to ridiculous know that obama got wonderful news on a lot away doing folks what the hell are we doing what the hell are we doing so i said they said look behind me that love this country remember that and then i said its not the greatest two weeks ago i started saying this is a ron is gonna take over iraq iraq has the largest oil reserves in the world second in the world among the richest beautiful oil and i mean the best highestquality thats iraq now i ron and i said this in reuters dont do it youll be stable and im the most militaristic person in this room i will tell you ok believe me believe me nobody is gonna mess with us were gonna be strong going to be powerful and nobodys gonna mess and hopefully well hopefully hopefully well have to use that power but you know when you are strong and you really really strong and people know it and yet the right leader that a mess with you babe message gonna be all right now their toys they talking with us they toiled with us you look at it china toys with us they built in the south china sea a phenomenal i mean its incredible its a fort with runways for planes for bombers for ever think they dont care about us they dont care about us we cant even put up a wall at that building a thing and you know by the way one of the reasons we didnt build the wall we couldnt get fifteen years ago we could get the environmental impact statement you believe it not show they couldnt get an invite because the stones and all sorts of stuff theyre going to build a wall this way to avoid to avoid red i read i snail about two billion more just do if you turn theres a snake in the way theres a rattlesnake its very rare lets move the wall about a mile last and give a little turned a wall that look like a press so so china in the south china sea is building a massive military compound with runways and everything and you know they do environmental impacts that they have the biggest excavators youve ever seen and theyre ripping the hell out of the ocean theyre ripping and dumping and theyre ripping and their debts almost finished and they do it they supposed to do it no do they have any respect for us know did they suck us dry on trade yes theyve taken so many jobs millions of jobs thousands and thousands of factories and theyre great i dont mind you know what its ok im angry at our people im not angry at them if they can get away with it its great im not upset with him im upset with the people that we have that allowed our country to be salvaged like this the greatest deal ive ever seen is what iran did where theyre taken over iraq now if you think of it watch ive been really good at this stuff i was the first one i said bomb the oil pump the oil balm the oil who got the oil a lot of it i says i should have been saying you know some of you have listened to bomb the everybody said and then they actually interviewed on one of the networks about a year ago one of the generals mr trump is very insistent on bombing ooo that would never work bombing the oil you know we have generals echoing talk shows all the time you think general george patton would have been big on the talk shows he would have you want to have this war over before it had a chance to go from his base to the studio where they fell on the talk show trucks were in bad shape whats going to happen now is we have created a monster power with tehran iran takes over iraq theyve got it got it that you know people so they havent what they have done it and iraq dow is looking to iran for protection the whole thing is chris the whole thing is crazy but now they take over yemen didnt want them in but they want the border between saudi arabia because they want to take over the island saudi arabia a saudi arabias very rich saudi arabian hijab protection to get a pass something they need to take a given something folks we dont have the money i want to protect you i want to take care

immigrants it taken care of better than our incredible veterans and its not going to happen to do trunk can you imagine that with all of these characters running on foreign policy truck and you know its very you can say well maybe some i think that people want to see strong then went to see strength they want to see protection they want to be protected and thats it i watch list and i watched the president truly didnt know what he was doing he did why he was there he refuses to use the term radical islamic terrorism he refuses to use the term i dont even know who knows what is going on i know how its just gonna be an extension of obama i think maybe worse shes got no strength shes got no salmon remember that you dont need a president with no strain of salmonella when were being written to trade with being ripped off on obamacare which should be repealed and replaced by myself taken care of what jerry is never been like it is today one of the generals was on television as usual daily with elise prepare now anytime that hes ever seen it and hes been there a long time retiring thats how we are in the most dangerous world weve ever had because of the power of weapons we have people that dont know im telling you i watched i watch his generals the interview general george patton would be interviewed they do the total and complete victory general douglas regard their first day talk later these guys and i dont think well have to you know just bush he said yesterday was the interview he said that he was elected as a percent something like those things youll find out but if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the talk dial trial is not nice whose heads of jumped up in the middle east christian and for other reasons drowned and steel cages and we talked about my tom foolery said the same thing other stone is not nice living in a different plan we need somebody whos strong we need somebody was incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things you know a lot of people but then thats everything we need tough we need in this country we own trillion the budget they signed two weeks ago is he making truman its a trillion trillion dollars per gallon heard of the word trillion dollars in the very near future we are really in trouble we have to rebuild our country we have to rebuild our infrastructure we have to rebuild our military and yet we do deals with china with this trade imbalance of four hundred billion dollars a year in their favor by the ship and they said the cars by the millions seventy billion dollars here imbalance like were going to build a wall it will lol i really stop on hillary was at least people you know this fifteen i had very strong he went down governor walking nice guy he went to every kind we gotta keep it that way to grandmas hes got literally zero and the kids talk and get so much television television and hes his ideas are so bad im more military see in him but i know how to live he does he was just attack everything john mccain sometime the holy city but gotta know what i was against the war in iraq so i just wrote you have to write a great temperament dunno what you doing i said if you attack a wrap around is gonna take over the entire middle east because you are ruined it was so simple to me and actually they sent a group from the white house because i got so much publicity so much publicity that they sent a groom from the white house see missus see if you can have a rain check over the middle east and thats whats happened and arrest them and take over iraq issuers you sitting there and by the way iraq with the second largest oil reserves and we lost thousands of the house we have wanted worries level of all over the place two trillion dollars we have nothing we got absolutely and we left and we have a president but then we should elect the way we left good and really make our country great that if i spoke to that young woman that i really think i could convince him that were all in this together we want to have a strong we want to have a good guy this is a great guy thank you but you know if you think about it and you have some of the can never be satisfied no matter what they just troublemakers but most people arent and they believe something that has some very slight friends on agree with me that the other side but i really believe that we have to be was same person i got a judge yourself by the securities just say you can do very nice to you cell number thank you very nice person in the same thing you would think that everybody will say that everybody every single person thank you in fact is that all there is about the presidents speech and i wrote something today and i think is very very important and probably not politically correct but i dont hear in california where somebody was making bombs in an apartment the mothers mother didnt notice anything will i watched believe me in my opinion she was lying like crazy i watched my brother was such a wonderful guy didnt know i didnt know i didnt know and i watched the next joint saying we didnt read them just didnt want a racial profiling parade would like to see the country so many different ways itself imagine what a great leaders of the past said with the kind of crap thats happening with us they didnt want to replace them because they thought it was ok you know the the pipe bombs all of the above is this long to many of them together but we didnt want to rush the k you are or how bout with the families and friends go back with the worst worst because with the world trade said they would killing innocent civilians at least dirty rotten sneak attack at least while it was but this was an attack on the world trade so whats happened is whereas we have no idea was coming into our country we have no idea what they hate us we have no idea if they want to bomb us we have no idea whats going on and then i looked at called him winning those numbers are like looking at these subjects i hated to look at age its very very sad i go after some of the numbers of those industries honda center for security policy very highly respected this is people living in this country of those holes agree violence against americans is just as much as and whistles living in this country by the way i have friends that it was a great people but they dont have a problem they know we have a real and we cant put up with it sucks we cant put up with it highlyrespected no groups want to be governed according to shariah you know it sure is so i wrote this at the nation watched serenity a constitution the mainstream media these people they are so to say so this one from nbc reporter from nbc and actually another one i think from cbs they actually in columbus ohio has a tremendous traffic people it was a love fest in one on for a long time everybody right to the end right julianne i had one of the politicians cases just hes hes a powerful debater he made a statement that oh they left after minutes now the press is the company says it was alive at the end of the beginning nobody nobodys leaving here we asked the press was a total lie and they dont want to do that because you know we get the biggest crowds they dont show this to people outside trying to get it to show the people here its a record in the history of and yes i guarantee you that young women to just got taken out after interrupting us three times i guarantee i guarantee so we talk about the media and by the way some of the medias two remaining is absolute absolute remember this one of the other day where i finish the stage and they said oh drop was interrupted and he left like i den and should question questions and then i went around you know everybody amazingly this a media group that calls the next to the most beautiful sorry about what life was from nbc shes there shes back there what i live in bc two hundred was a total lie and they just didnt know that they actually criticized the media and they said it was a total and then other people pick up somebody picks it up there rate reported remember watch the surrender and our constitutional rights and i dont want to i want ice is to surrender a little bit of the country has made great day to suppose that i like that i have more we can call the election tomorrow coming in on these to go the quiet and johnny people are fed up with incompetent they are just stupid people where r president makes a deal to such an bergdahl they knew it was a dreaded just in general and a colonel went to see his grip six people killed look into her parents are television has seen the parents but i watched some television deficit they left to try and bring them back she left you know the old days when we were struck be now the other day can you believe they think hes gonna get away with nothing is going to happen nothing so we left untreated in pretty rough though he got in the way i saw anyway so

there are trying to kill everybody in front of them including you so we get bergdahl and they get the killers and thats the way we doing here and we gave them a hundred and fifty billion dollars just called amateur night we gave them one hundred and fifty billion dollars days days we think theres something wrong days we have to wait but its much longer because as a whole process before the clock start but the best when they have the right to self you doing tomorrow we dont negotiations always happen and somebody would say thats profiling trust she agreed to go she is so hot and i dont blame for losing cause a lot of things were happening i was a tough one but i shoulda one when he sort of went away on vacation or something and i said to myself recent box just came out as being hillary very easily we watch this and its impossible to watch this gross incompetence that i watched last week without us a little while and these people going crazy sorry this is calling for a pretty remember this calling for a total and complete shutdown muslims and drink the united states figure out why the hell is going off we have no insurance according to research among others there is a great for americans by the large sections of the muslim population most recently from security policy released showing percent of those polled agreed that violence against americans to people that i hear people here one percent would be unacceptable was unacceptable of those call violence against americans here in the united states is just as high as global jihad not going to happen as low as percent of those polled agreed that muslims in america should have to joyce just being governed according to shariah shariah authorized main tera chehra authorize such as believers who wont be heading and more unthinkable acts that pose two americans / ass ashley and we have a president who wanted to mention the term and you talk about numbers like this without looking at the various polling down its obvious to anybody that hatred is beyond comprehension where they come from and why this could get worse and worse the world trade centers gonna go where we can be politically correct we can be stupid but its worse until were able to determine an unjust and ej credit losses our country cannot be horrendous attacks by the police only is he didnt want to have no reason for respect for human life they have no respect for human life he sounds like hes very exhausting so so we have to decide we can be weak effect be very gentle very gentle this a try be very nice so try to pass by the way if some people in those places where we have done the second amendment we have to preserve it and cherish it and we cant let these weak leaders if they had guns in paris five people in that room paris and france has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world looks like target practice but people are sitting and many others are gonna be dying is sitting in a hospital in many cases waiting to die now same thing a few days no guns we didnt have the bad guys and these people and i just the press you gotta stop calling a mastermind season member the guy in the mastermind human some of them disgusted me and we have just watching the internet and they want to be missed and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids they go over there and we have our anchors i think i can almost hear it too much but they say the young man and parasite called him the guy with the jurys still he had to sign guy puts people in this message being so the press has to be responsible people because of the internet and we have to do something we have to go see a lot of different people that really understand what happened to talk maybe in certain areas closing that internet up in some way we have a lot of real estate we have a lot of jewish people weve got a maybe do so because they are recruiting by the thousands and when they come back which is where are you i was fighting for us when they leave our country and they go to fight i just any of the other groups they never come back they never came and now they become radicalized now about the lemon juice pakistan then she wins she comes in and engaged and she let the guy i couldnt get a woman hes ever had in awhile but he became radicalized quickly and then they go on those days are those things we have to be tough yes we have to look at how we have to respect my ass but yes we have to look at my house we have no choice we have to see whats happening its happening in there is anger and we have to do we cant be these people that is sitting back like in the world trade show only so many different things we cant be people that knew what was going on to excel in california probably so much done soon i didnt want to tell in the week

the first one but i love in these rooms all the same unbelievable of in all of these places oklahoma people standing in a park one quick now this is an unbelievable love and this is unbelievable of the country we want to see and we believe in the constitution more than anything but we cant let people use and abuse are right we cant let people they want to kill us they want to destroy us we cant let it happen we just cant let it happen and i have a friend whos a very very successful and i went to one event with the people and this guys really tough guy one of the guys i definitely used to negotiate with japan china believe me you are going to be in good shape that happens when one of these characters of these guys by the way funding these other guys getting millions and millions of

unbelievable cash and everybody said i took a deep breath to my life and we came down there has to have read the famous as many have turned around to a country that had been positive then they said i will these talking heads most of whom are not even some people believe then they should love it when they went to this but they say once brilliant because he was too but what happens is they said well

direction and if a few people and i say sometimes i look at the audience that guy right there that right that beautiful woman right here but if we had guns strapped right onto the way believe me if we had a gun strapped onto the bullet going in the opposite way too different story however the military base a year ago we had five so great gun free zone right done job nobody better with guns and weapons and this man won all the awards the other foot rachel is wacko shoot guns of four hundred yards away gun free zone you know when you say the sick baby we get rid of my gun free zone problems because actually we have how much number one place and i say the united states is the largest purchase drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs but that doesnt have the right people so they have the region because without that and then you have with the evangelicals in the united find out you know yesterday we always talk about china and the president of china our trading partner a wonderful partner they take if they cant be the f play the fighter right you know about that did you hear about that you cant tell the difference you look at it the company plans and they did i guarantee you write down the most complicated mathematical solutions all done hundredpercent stolen off our web and day and thats right hilary but every time i go after what i dont understand when you see the night and then how could you do that how many why what is going on and why and then you look at the bottom you can possibly do that i mean thats like hours a day who can do that many thats like one little match so i dont know hilary is gonna get a chance to win by the way im beating her in the polls id love to run against wright also love to run against the communists i never thought today in our country when you think about it when a communist the real numbers come out shes really i watched them i say you mean we have this great country we have this so i watch i watch this great country and if that the best we can do thats pretty sad when you think of it so we love so i would around hundreds of acres right in the middle of miami right near the airport we had a big darrell tournament championship and its great nobody else has jobs with dead with related and a lot of places in my life going to know about it a lot of money i love this state i love this day but but ive created tremendous numbers of jobs down so drought market was bad thats when you like to buy right when the markets bit so i go in and we signed a contract everybody wanted everybody we go ahead and i signed a consistent way the country should help im saying because this is the way the country should be run so i go in and was very competitive everybody wanted to but i was the first one they had to sell it as a lot of problems and i bought it and i signed contract i signed contract for a hundred and seventy million dollars for which is very cheap but it had to be redone you know in the meantime you see what we did i spent a lot of money minute incredible the best so and a lot of people who work in a lot of good people a lot of hispanics are working there and by the way by the way by the way today i just settled with univision but a lot of this work for me ive been through a house in and a lot and we have a lot but the route so i signed contract right now i go in for a run into an interview with now ill do it ready to sign a contract and then i say no this just remember what we have to do with china mexico where everyones moving it to mexico i just heard carrier air conditioners moving in the business is moving in united everybody by the way how quiet house you know hes my friend but hes really a pain to keep quiet quiet quiet hes not a protester but mancini so theyre all moving into mexico y by drought we havent closed yet and i said to my daughter ivanka has anybody heard of it and i go through it was gonna make it but its really bad so i go back and i need all these guys from the wharton school from harvard and i said im not gonna pay im not doing too much money if i didnt promise that i wouldnt use bad language i would have used much stronger like it would have been more interesting than the places in lousy condition i dont like it im not pay tribute to frighten me they said no way ill give you a hundred they said no way hundred should know what to watch for me its fun its again for john kerry its work its labors is that the saddest but for me its just a fun whether i paid for a good price you got at the right time so i said if we go in we meet these geniuses i say you got to cut the price its not what you told us i did it its fiction its a terrible terrible shape you got it the way they should know what will make somebody else to break it they should in no way no way were gonna do it within about three minutes haitian how much would you take i said ill give you a hundred and ten they should we can do that we can get away after about four minutes we agreed to take twenty million off i paid for four minutes work as a twenty million dollars right now we have now you take dollars and it took forever two days later im elected president they would have been out we dont mean for us for our people getting those hostages back to say no when you leave within a couple of days palace hundred and fifty what does hostages landed about two seconds later tell us how you doing a hundred and fifty billion sorry we dont have the money we owe we dont have the money lets go two hundred and by the way this is in like maybe a hundred percent but we have people that dont know what theyre doing like john curry our secretary of state we have that dont know what the persians a great negotiators ok negotiated you look at what they did he never once we did every single point we have a day inspection they have with a selfrespect can you imagine a nuclear deal and we dont know what we call up with a complaint and they said will call you back tomorrow we will inspect the area they call you back tomorrow and they say the president everythings fine now you know the supreme leader we wont use the term supreme leader ok he says weve just spoken to the supreme leader probably because they want to kill you china two thousand years ago they didnt have caterpillar tractor by the way miles its a massive wall it does work you know the worlds work asked israels walls were believe how about europe some of the countries in europe that werent suckers to what happened with the migration like merkel of germany when she did to germany and they want to build walls around their own countries down because much going on in europe nobody knows where these people from and we all have a big heart i have a big heart you bill to allow millions of people to fill because their leaders are stupid leaders and you have to see the crime in germany now the crime in sweden so what happened with the beginning to rebound doesnt have the people the press illegal immigration and nobody from the media by the way but they have to leave he said the president not gonna happen were going down fast trash and its not gonna happen in the world and we have some three years we cant do it any longer well were not gonna be the stupid people anymore something happening we have we have you dont really mean were gonna build a wall to do absolutely build a wall gonna be real wall right now we have loved you say they build ramps i dont know what they just dont not go over the wall that bill ramps over the wall up and it probably is a severe penalty for not getting theyve been no we dont give severe penalties right now a severe penalty you know we have great border patrol i was in laredo texas and i was asked i was the guest of the border patrol they called and they said would love to see you great people and they want to protect and they can do it but theyre told to stand back let people come through it is so are within obama signs executive order let everyone weve lost control if we dont have a broader we dont have a country folks have a country so these guys nice guys some of them and they said he was gonna build it would simply you know fifteen years ago they wanted to build a wall they could build it because they couldnt get the environmental impact statement approved can you believe they have they have also want two things they couldnt get it environment can you believe this ive been saying the oil right over ive been saying for years and now finally it took paris and who is the first one to bomb the french can you believe that won the french the french but ive been saying for years and what happens they dont do it one of the reasons because the environment through can you believe why do you think general george patton would general douglas macarthur are great modern day general what do you think they would tell you right now yeah im the only one i said dont go into iraq im the most militaristic person in this room except for that guy right day probably be on the militaristic person in this room believe me were going to build on military so big so we are going to be nobodys gonna play with us nobodys gonna miss bestequipped i think i make it a struggle would never gonna have to use it i actually think we can do it but right i think its the cheapest thing we can do we have to check what he said at least four like many years but i actually think hes a are prepared and this is what we need with all these maniacs coming in when we want to take people from the migration line we have no idea who that we have absolutely no idea they have no paperwork there is absolutely no way we can never tell and ill tell you folks would not take it on and if we do take him from somebody else was sending back that we have no choice we have and we have to like they used to be done and the people of our country theyre incredible people and they really love the country and how could you get them because the cost of the law is peanuts i havent even figured out the cost the cost of the law is peanuts absolute peanuts compared to the kind of money that mexico is making off the united states and thats not including all of the drugs that are flowing right thats not a so these guys will never ever asked out if you talk about that mexico has lobbyists believe it or not everybody has a lobbyist every person that deals with the united states have lobbyists and special interest so when they come to me they should lift layoff mexico little bit you know they cant do that because nobody gave me money and i wouldnt do it and im working for one group of people and thats this group of people the head of his finance committee is a friend of mine is putting johnson hes from johnson and johnson woody johnson johnson and johnson has a hard time with the jet johnson is a good guy hes the head of his finest so then you wonder why is it that the politicians dont put out drugs to competitive bidding and then he wouldnt johnson died when he was governor we have what kind of cities do we havent welcome is right we have sanctuary cities in florida while he was right after he left florida went down i would see a florida went to hell and this is what we have but in doing so when you have what do you know you have other woody johnsons feeding other people in other industries taking care of all these people so when they go up and then they say some twentyfive years but i dont wanna we need the cover of time magazine that story was something special now weve all wasted a lot of time weve always had a lot of energy in my case ive wasted a lot of money if this doesnt happen i dont care about the money but the energy is incredible i think we have a really good chance you know when we won new hampshire when we won new hampshire there were questions like talked about the muslim we have a tremendous problem and i said we have to study it we have to see that has to be a bit nobodys gonna say that we have problems folks we have a problem we gotta find out radical islamic terrorism we have a president wont even use the term you cant solve a problem if youre afraid of it you cant solve a problem if youre not even mentioned were gonna make our country so strong gonna win again and again were gonna win but hes like have to do you have to go out and vote for wasting our time the movie so i wanted you people ive been all over and what i said to my friend is true i love you people get out and were gonna make america great again were gonna win were gonna bring our country back and were all gonna be proud once again thank youpc board member abby friedman good afternoon and welcome to the rjc presidential presidential candidates for him my name is abby friedman and im a national board member of the rjc from las vegas nevada as you know your dishes a great language it expresses feeling and character to yiddish words that dont often appear in the same sins nevertheless seemed to capture the unique nature of the leading candidate for the republican presidential nomination donald trump is a mensch with foot spa im at donald trump thirty years ago through my work as an attorney in the atlantic city gaming industry so i know that while hotspur gets the headlines he is also a mention at heart i saw this personally when three key senior executives of trumps gaming companies tragically died in a helicopter crash in donald trump stood with a completely devastated community with extraordinary compassion generosity and bold character behind the headlines earning the title of mensch as for huts both really donald trump candidacy is built on hotspur on a fearless ability and tenacity to tell it like he sees it even if some people dont want to hear it especially when people dont want to hear it among the presidential republican candidate donald trump may also be the most closely connected to the jewish people his daughter and his two grandchildren are jewish i guess theoretically it makes him he is also a vocal supporter of israel and its great leader by minister though he has raised his voice often and loudly in support of israel safety and security for that we are extremely grateful donald trump says it has to be said to whomever needs to hear it right now america needs to hear it because americas in trouble and its going to take a whole lot of foot spa to make it great again and so it is my honor to introduce the front runter frontrunner for the republican presidential nomination a captain of industry investor author public personality and candid of the united states amends with a lot of ladies and gentlemen donald trump you just like me because my daughter happens to be jewish right she has a great husband jared and ill tell you if i could not be happier and shes very proud the only bad news i cant get her on saturday i call and call i cant i cant speak to my daughter anymore and saturday so but thats okay its an honor to be with you and you have devoted so much time of my life to israel and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they havent done what ive done ive received many many awards i was the grand marshal was the grand marshal of the israeli day parade at a very dangerous time when people said dont do it dont do it i walked up fifth avenue im looking up for lots of trouble but i said no way that im not going to do it and it was a rough time as you know is and it was a tremendously successful bread maybe the most successful parade that they ever had a different position than the other candidates because im the one candidate i dont want any of your money i want to support but i dont want your money im self funding my campaign its been an amazing experience for me because i have very little money invested so frightened by this time but have about thirty million dollars in ads and have done all i took a small radio commercial the other day and iowa but i we have virtually no money invested in eads or advertising and i think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respected and at first i was embarrassed by the said well you know i think were gonna have to spend money just to spend money but its not really like a good thing to do because i am interest place by a lot not even close every single poll every single state the numbers just came in three minutes ago in new hampshire the pee pee people trumpet the next one is and the rest are off the board they have to drop out pretty soon i get most important favorability now i still like them the top number most but favorability is now which is good good and i beat hillary in the fox polish you see very easily thats ultimately the most important and you know ive been a tremendous fan and ive been a tremendous contributor ive given a lot of money recently to hide saleh emergency response they do a fantastic they do a fantastic job and my father fred was always a big supporter so i i grew up in that environment where i grew up in brooklyn queens and israel was always very paramount in our mind in fact ive been sometimes criticized as i receive so many awards from jewish groups and they look at my wall to load it up and but now the christians are catching up i have to tell you why christians alike in me a lot lately and theyve been great so obama is the worst thing thats ever happened to israel and and when i see great friends of mine who are very very proisrael very i mean they love it with passion and having fundraiser so what are you doing and its almost like they dont know he comes to we dont know i say is a disaster i really believe the rnd look im gonna go she liked you folks would negotiate is we dont build gas stations in the middle of as you know afghanistan million in legend is a small gas station million dollars and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they dont sell that type of gas ok million bucks for gas station how many think they could have done it for less would you raise your hands place but i look at obama i look at that deal we gave to a red hundred and fifty billion dollars they dont need to develop nuclear weapons taken by him they can buy amidst room why do they have to develop them they can buy a wii game hundred fifty billion dollars they go out and in terms of you know surveillance they have the right to self and spec tell about that on the major the most dangerous they can self inspect themself inspect and then you have of course days but the days world good with contracts dont start until suchandsuch happens it could be forever before you have a go in to inspect and we dont even get up and now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they won nineteen people for our three they dont want to give us up for you know a four but they only want to talk three now that should have been negotiated right at the beginning three years ago and maybe better than anyone in some of the people in this room understand what im saying it should have been you walk in by the way did you ever see a negotiation take so long and we conceded on every single anything we didnt win anything but that should have been with our prisoners day one whatever it is years ago we have to get our prisoners back you dont want them we need him itll make us look better those everybodys gonna like us more with the american public any deal we strike its gonna look good and we have to get our prisoners back day one they gonna say no were not giving and were gonna say bye bye bye callers when youre ready and then we go out and double up a triple up to sanctions i guarantee you within hours theyre calling begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisons its so easy now that president you saw that and john kerry who is probably the worst negotiator ive ever seen have ever seen he did not read the art of the deal folks i can tell you now hes one of the few as one of the biggestselling of all time the business because he didnt read it and obama definitely dinero bhama but they said this is hard to believe but this is what they say lot of press back there so i have to say everything exactly correct because i dont they end up with it they said we didnt want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the presence is really complicated we want to present his back so complicated they said they didnt want to go so now were gonna end up making a new deal probably at some point i can you this i just tell you this i win before i take office i guarantee those prisoners gonna be back they gonna be back to get it back now our president doesnt want to use the term we had another event which probably was the one yesterday probably was related it always happens but probably was when i heard about it i think it maybe not but it turns out probably was related radical islamic terrorism and ill tell you what we have a president that refuses to use the term he refuses to say it theres something going on with him that we dont know about as concerned with what he wants she shouldnt be allowed to run what she did is criminal with the emails she shouldnt be allowed shes going to have to follow his line because shes on a threat in real life his attorney general has us attorney his attorney general to his attorney general can listen to him in my opinion i think its very dishonest whats going on with our government general petraeus was given a life changing sentence other people have been sent to jail petraeus was essentially look we dont want to get into it with the pool guy but he wont say nothing compared to what she did for nothing percent of what she did and obama i mean she cant go against him that he had ever so when you see hillary backing up virtually everything he says and hes got control of her i mean its just total control but ill tell you what she shouldnt be allowed to run what she did was a criminal act and remember this is a six you have a sixyear statute of limitations so shes fighting for life if she doesnt go to become president you could have a real problem doesnt make any sense does that make sense anymore because what she did was just ok and you know shes been involved in corruption her own life whether its whitewater i meet her home life is corruption she was a horrible she was a horrible secretary of state she did a horrible job other than travel a lot traveled a lot nothing ever got that the whole the world blew up around her it blew up to calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didnt respond the truth is she doesnt have the strength of the energy she responded to a friends used you know the friends were talking about some of those trends are sort of an interesting sort of an interesting trend going on there but she responded you get them but she responded to a friend but she doesnt respond she doesnt respond to an ambassador did says can help hundreds hundreds of requests and she doesnt remember this i go every night and i mean yesterday i was in manassas virginia an unbelievable crowd the other day i was in florida we had twelve thousand people in sarasota at twelve oclock in the afternoon with the football games going on people the convention center held five thousand so we had thousands outside i made a speech outside made two speeches avenue to give me a larger convention center nd speech by people said no thats the biggest one we set a record a big record we set a record everywhere in one of the centers we beat the record of elton john sir elton john im im no longer competing with politicians im competing with musical talent one of the great musician said you get the largest crowds of any single human being on earth without a guitar meaning who doesnt count on music so its true weve had weve had tremendous response weve had incredible response and i think you know if you look at whats going on and i think based on the response based on the polls again i dont want your money therefore youre probably not going to support me good stupidly you want to give money money even though hes better than all these guys even though hes gonna do more for israel than anybody else even though bibi netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for me i did anyone happy about that and they said i was only celebrity i dont know this but they said im the only celeb that are not not a celebrity now politician im so embarrassed by that term you know my whole life ive been a businessman up in a developer i been somebody ive employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime i have unbelievable statements an unbelievable company a lot of people said hell never filed this youll never run because hell never won a file various papers and then hell never filed this and then you have to sign your life away the first paper we all know that first paper you sign your life when he did it then they say well hell never sign his financials because who knows maybe is not as rich as people think i found my financials almost a hundred pages the biggest ever filed by the federal elections and it is much bigger much stronger look at these numbers and what they dont know if i didnt run i probably would have filed anyway because you know i built a great company and i like to brag about it whenever possible true some of the greatest assets doral you know doral and and turnberry in scotland and trump tower at many buildings in manhattan just many build bank of america building in san francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things and its just so much bigger and so and the reason i bring that up his cause thats the kind of thinking we need and i dont bring it up his braggadocio because thats the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back we have people that dont know the first thing about the word negotiation i cant take anybody in this office believed me and theyre better than obama and theyre better than carry and theyre better than foolish people people its so embarrassing when you see what happens sergeant bergdahl alright sergeant brett till we get a trader they get five of the greatest killers that theyve wanted for nine years you know the deal was and they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal you know about sergeant he just said it six people were killed trying to get them back they were looking for a general and a colonel deserted he was a traitor and we still made the deal so we get a trader we can get back to you want to renegotiate some of us renegotiate yes i would say about is there anybody that doesnt renegotiate deals in this room this room negotiator i want to read this perhaps more than any room ive ever spoken to maybe more so far been called in there but the fact is i want to renegotiate that deal i want to drop him right smack in the middle of worry came from the hell were they can happen even if we dont get the five guys back to thats not gonna happen cuz you know where they are right now there right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and killing anybody that gets him so they get their five guys that they wanted for nine years theyve won and we get a dirty rotten trader but thats the way our way up people negotiate this stupid people ok this stupid its very severe its very scared so i just tell you that im going to win yeah ive been unless something happens you know across the street the wrong thing happens but i think whatever great secret service here is nice when your number one they give you a secret service i never saw so many talented people great people but i believe im going to win i really great feeling about it and you know my life has been about winning have one in my life has been about winning and thats what i want to do for the country and people say about my company in deals and you can do this deal that had no interest the other day if shes doing so great dad we can buy this wonderful office building its amazing see now im dealing in trillions i never heard a trillions before you know with this we r trillion dollars we just signed a budget that so bad and the republicans you know what we know that we know if the democrats are coming from but these republican politicians they go to washington and didnt and obamacare which im doing by the way im ending up terminating its gonna be repealed and replaced with something much better but they go to washington and they gonna do and theyre gonna do budgets like i heard the guy before melvin work on the budget is all about that what happened is they gotta do budget agreement to do this and that and i tell the story then they will contain the capitol building which is magnificent and they look up look at those columns look at the ceiling look at the angels look at these magnificent never seen anything like it weve arrived credible and then they become inch they lose all of their courage i want to use a nice words otherwise i get reported wrestling they lose they lose all of their courage and theyve let us down that wont happen with me so again youre not gonna support me even though you know im the best thing that could ever happen to israel and i i ill be there at the rear dont want your money i want to give money i think i have a damn good judge and i think i get more money than anybody else you know the money i have turned down this is not in my life turning down money guys wanna give me made against i would have made poor jeb bush me this poor guy with his low energy its sad but whats it came up with a terrible became so defining its like having it on his forehead i am lower is million dollars which means shes control totally totally control by the people the game the month thats why you dont want to give me money ok but thats ok you want to control your own politician thats fine good but i will think about that folks that dont worry about five months ago i was with you who is better than me who is better than me i gave to the republican governors association everything got a letter of thank you i didnt receive one letter not one letter from one governor stupid the good thing is i dont give anyone anymore you dont get a thank you letter politicians remember this politicians forget politicians generally arent competent and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and thats what you gonna do but i would love you support but i dont want your money and i appreciated now lets take some questions ok a little bit different than how you gonna work out into your speech the hotel you are building right next door to this property ladder im i did you disappointed you cost me im building a tremendous actually give me actually but im gonna go there right after this i have to go through you know you have to watch to make sure the contractors arent stealing and ripping you off and everything else so but just show you how important this fall is and how important the country is the man how important it is to me i dont mention my projects very important to me anymore whats really important to me is the united states and make any great again my theme is make america great again i mean its taken off like crazy the hottest its going crazy but it happens to be a great you know some of these guys tried to copy it but i had a trademark smart couple of them got up now they see why i was making a speech and everybody stood up make america great again this study can be but nobody stood up for them but we sent him a little notice dont use it can you imagine i got the approval but i we are were building a great hotel down the road i hope you all say and its going to be wonderful come out lets go yesterday you gave some interviews he made a speech in manassas talking about an upcoming trip to you gonna make this right he also talked about how you wanted to raise some questions regarding when talking about the israelipalestinian issue you raised questions about israels commitment to peace my love for you to do you say to have to make some tough sacrifices so to that group to this group here those tough sacrifices that mean return to the borders dividing jerusalem exactly so i was interviewed yesterday by a whole group of reporters have maybe and if they did a very good job fairs and one of the questions was about israel and the palestinians what whats going to happen i said i use that as an example of some deals that it may be the hardest ever in history to make of any gift until we think of any type we all have to feel you know we have some good results and how we use damn good man good man very nice asiasat everybody in this audience but but i said people gonna have to make sacrifices one with my belief i believe that i can put both sides together but i said itll take six months at the end of six months and maybe sooner you know we have a deal instinct a lot of us and you walk into a room you can tell almost like in two seconds whether or not whether or not i will know very quickly whether or not ill be able to put a deal together i used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together the strongly no tougher deal if i can do that it would make me so happy because theres so much violence so much debt so much and just been going on for so many years now i said you have to have a commitment i dont know that israel has the commitment to make it and i dont know that the other side is the commitment to make it with that being said you know have a good chance of winning because you look at whats going on and to have a good chance i dont like to as a deal maker give away a lot of cards by talking about how i feel about this is that id rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room i dont want one side or the other saying look i think people know where i stand ok but it wouldnt it be great if they could make it but a lasting till a real deal not a phony deal thats going to last a week and then bad things are happening again id love to and i will give you know about his as you know he said it wont happen during weight meaning he gave up in this before even started but i think it would be a great thing for israel i think it would be a great thing actually for both sides if a real deal could be made and im gonna give it my best im a great deal maker thats what i do i made a lot of money im gonna give it my best it would be great if that deal could be made let me go one point us president bush wrote a letter to prime minister sharon in which he basically said you s position wasnt gonna be two forces will back to borders the obama administration has given a lot and a lot of people dont know that i think the public relations for is your hasnt been so great israels given a lot but hasnt been given a lot of credit for what they give i dont know if you agree with unthinkable and lot of turmoil caused it but id like to go in with a clean slate and just say lets go everybodys even we love everybody can do something but i do think this and i do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons im saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that israel has given i dont know whether or not they want to go that final step up to them but israel has not been given the credit they deserve what theyve done i was really trying to pin you down on jerusalem is the undivided capital position you support you know what i want to do i want to wait till i meet with bb and im leaving for israel in a very short period of time i know i know what you saying i just wanted to just youre not gonna be on tuesday wiseguy than we have ever just relax ok jung you like me very much believe me ok then you wonder why you get yourself in trouble alright you like me very much its gonna be fine but again you cant go in with that if you can make a deal and you can make a great deal with the attitude we gonna shove it that you gotta go get it and do it and do it nicely everyones happy very happy ok dont worry about obviously you know youve been an outspoken defender prime minister netanyahu said you made a tv commercial a very good man i think hes been treated very badly i think that our president has been unbelievably rude to bb i dont know how many people like me but i think hes talked about deals after the fact which is a shame i think the iran deal is the worst single thing perhaps has been ive been pretty good at predicting things i think its gonna go down as the worst single thing thats ever happened to israel i think its a catastrophe for it and i think the fact that obama was willing to make that deal anybody that loves israel to support this guy or even the democratic party is is impossible to believe i think there will be one of the great catastrophe but if i get in its gonna be straighten out tough and its gonna be straighten out fast the one bad thing is if i get in the one hundred and fifty billion that hurts me and that hurts the people in this room but the hundred and fifty billion dollars because itll be gone before you get there you know were talking about a year and more actually although the election very quick you know its coming up its now less than a year and you know we have the the iowa starts on february st right down the line and its very exciting were talking about a couple of months now for it to start to actually very fair person like me and its very exciting so the other guys have a great relationship with prime minister netanyahu which the other arab leaders use or know where can you see yourself working with you think you have a positive working relationship i havent been working too much with the arab leaders to be honest ok i made commercials bb i dont know if thats going to help me in the negotiation i can tell you trying to keep it nice and level right then i get people screaming at me but im trying to keep it is level as possible but for the most part dont know the king of jordan is it seems like a nice man i dont know a lot of people like him some people dont but i think i will probably be able to what my history is you know i took some heat because i get along with democrats i get along with liberals i get along with conservatives i get along with republicans argue thats what i was a business person i get along with everybody we have to get along with everybody and i took it wouldnt be easy to get along with everybody democrats republicans on even run people for the most part and if they do theyre gonna get you know theyre to get a very small percentage of the vote can get along with everybody i think thats going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in washington we have people that they dont talk you know i remember years ago cause i have been a very political person always on the other side but always great political but years ago the republicans and the democrats like each other they get along that have dinner together disagree and what have you know different views on things but in the evening that go out and have dinner together with their families you dont see that theres total hatred and his total gridlock ill give you one point which i think is important corporate inversions right she had companies leaving the united states and theyll even better taxes and better a lot of things but they leaving how good as pfizer thousands and thousands of jobs are gonna be lost but theyre also leaving because we have two and a half trillion dollars at least i think its a much higher number than two and a half trillion dollars thats out of the country that these companies cant get back because of bureaucracy and horrible horrible agreements but because the taxes are too hot there so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money up so they leave it over there and actually take the company and they move the company to the money because thats how much money the republicans and the democrats totally agree that the money should come back for three years they can get a deal theres no leadership this is an example of something which everybody agrees all the people that you see up here they all agree but they cant get it done because their politicians theyre all talk and no action so theres something undersold port its not like something with a dont get angry like his big disputes and we understand that this is something everybody agrees the money should pour into this country and we should use that money and all things taxes paid but they agree and they cant get it done because of gridlock and incompetent leadership hillary clintons your friend of israel you know honestly i dont think anybody can say she says but now she says all of a sudden you thought because shes going very very far over to the other side i mean bernie sanders has brought her two positions that she didnt want to be it you look at some of the things she saying right now but ill tell you whether she isnt she doesnt have the strength of the energy tail and i said it but just take a look should come out into an event that you dont see another four days three days true we dont need doesnt have his usual needs more than just a support they need strength they need real power behind as you know you look at these countries all over there is just one thing and i think youll all admitted these people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think right we still think it was easy fifteen years ago with my friends from israel has used to smiling fighters and in that theyre not the gv hey obama said that the jayvee tonight the jayvee folks we need tough we need general george patton we need general macarthur we dont need two guys we have i seen on television generous saying well i shes very tough i dont know i dont need to do you think general george patton they dont like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy so he would never make it probably would have been thrown out years ago but we need we need a genius and we have those people we have those people will find that person but with enough the crap out of them ill tell you what within a win with a win at a time but last question frank and water as you see it the greatest challenges facing the united states russia china radical islam i think radicalism right now is actually about to go again we have a president refuses to use the term but radical islam is a tell you one thing i know isnt is global warming thats the one thing thats one thing i know

is it easy to do its amazing i want to thank herman cain my friend for his wonderful remarks hes really a good guy right now wherever it is thank you i mean and you know we had a meeting today that was amazing we had the africanamerican pastors so many came up to trump tower it was like one of the most inspiring meetings it was an unbelievable the love they have for the people that they represent and people generally was incredible and i just want to tell you they left trump tower identify mediately got on the plane and i felt very inspired it was a really terrific day show and bruises here where expressed without wearing a brace bridge get over here bruce you know bridge so you know bruce bruce bruce all right now get them out if you never know when you ride with this guy i was in new york and i went up there guys on a serious note to just defend a lot of things that youve been seeing in the news that were totally false donald trump is not a racist guys probably never met him i met him several times actually wrote back on his plane got to help plan the plane with my beautiful wife sharon over here and we had a big meeting up at the trump headquarters and we had over hundreds of pastors that showed up that look like me and leaders across the country to denounce this rumor this accusation against this fine man its all guys when i want the first thing when i walked up to his office i looked around and it was so culturally diverse it was amazing most of the women were in charge they have the higher positions in his organization does john know that on a serious note i wont talk because its about donald trump i just wanna let you know that you know i am wholeheartedly thankful to be a part of this campaign and helped him and i hope you guys help him i know theres a lot of establishment guys i was part of the establishment nice to be a chairman and when a gop chair so we all know me but im here to tell you its not about anything else except you guys the people and i just want to let you know that donald trump is here for everyone hears every voice and hes our guy we met with many many pastors and it was just great so as you can see the people are still pouring out now we could we could get all of these people coming in right now if youd like to wait for minutes before we saw you want to do that i had a feeling you were going to say that i had a feeling its been going amazingly well you do have the mainstream you have been hearing about mainstream media all my life ive been hearing about it and its true i mean they dont give you accurate really representation its an amazing things they dont do it they dont do it unites constantly talk about the cameras in every show the crowds they never showed that grabs my wife is always disappointed you must not have had a good crowd tonight but now after about three or four times she understands they never want to show the crowd they never want to fan the cameras its an incredible think can you do it maybe once the cameras and camera i should be happy is focused on my face they never move it nobody knows whats going on because you really dont they dont want it sounds crazy they dont want to show the kind of response were getting so we had twelve thousand people we had twelve thousand and sarasota florida on saturday in an afternoon during football games biggest crowd ever theyd ever had a crowd even close the arena health six we had six outside inside i made two speeches and nobody knew that they dont talk about his sister is whats important is what were living in every single category winning every single poll just came out were beating hillary clinton even headtohead by a lot a lot but she does and thats not a nice thing to say is we cant afford to be so nice folks we dont have the option to know for a while we had a captains we could mess enough we dont have the options weve gotta get it right she doesnt have the strength or the stamina to be president she just does she does i know you have another shogun and one of these things and shell do something and its by the way the crowds are like the crowds are like people we were in new hampshire actually a part of massachusetts where half you know why i think so if tom brady likes you youre in pretty good shape and messages but we have percent in the poll and messages and were landing and hilary is nearby and shes going past and we are all of the police in massachusetts give us a motorcade you never saw anything like it was like motorcyclists roasting credit i actually said why do i have to be president no president ever had a motorcade like we just got and hillary we had people and right next door meaning miles up the road hillary had about people it was true and thats the way it is this just came out i dont know the other networks to keep their thinking but i might as well cnbc and she had a pretty lousy john harwood was a real stiff wasnt anyone what a joke he was it was so nice to me for three four weeks all yes respects from paul beeston look so forward we look so forward to having you and any right reads this question such a nasty cry tennis it what a nasty question right now theyre just a bunch of phony ppl but when it comes to this all say its good because i only its good news so good news tonight funny alright so this was even so it should staying home and it says youre the frontrunner republicans told basically you see the charts and that of truck runs more people are going out to vote in the elections it says no matter had no glasses on but these are mounted i didnt want to put the glasses on does it make sense to put him on no no dont do it dont do it okay im gonna do without no matter what party affiliation you consider truck brings them out this is cnbc republicans democrats and independents are all most likely to show up if trump is on the ballot in our analysis we assume constant whereas the democrats nominating hillary which is gonna happen unfortunately or fortunately id actually rather run against her she has done such a lousy job you know you know i dont like it is going to be the greatest job that she has ever done will be getting out of the email scandal assuming that happens that will be her greatest achievement you see all the classifieds today did thousands of that many here five thousand how do you have that many emails anyway but they have thousands of classified this disgusting frankly she should be allowed to run she shouldnt but the democrats are protecting her shes being fully protected as the expression goes at and by the way we cant tell anyone you know every time i did and tell jokes these guys put on like you know little sick like the belt right the belt you know what im talking about carson how it doesnt work that way if you hit and i wanted to like a whole big thing ciampi possible the belt requested some virtual dislike for three minutes and i pull over to the side and a start showing and i sought showing it they never show anything just at two or three second clip and playing with my belt and people dont know what the hell you doing its unbelievable and then i i talked about the other day i talked about a reporter who changed his story he changes to it and i go into this highly exaggerated phase of changing the search didnt say what you will about all they do is they show these little snippet they do whatever they can to make it official what im gonna do im gonna tell him what you folks im not going to kid are you ok so i well just know its my opponents do commercials with the two second snippet these are really dishonest people like this guy cases he did a commercial total stiff and beating a man im beating him in ohio by a lot and hes the governor of the people i was and i said that he had a certain problem right we have to go into it ok i well know i said he had a certain pathological problem now he wrote it i didnt write it and he said he suffers from pathological disease ok serious problem that we have enough problems in this world and i said essentially the people of iowa cant be that stupid and then i said that people of the united stage something to the effect that another attempt to them but everybody how can you vote for somebody with a problem like that im not even talking about going after the mother with a hammer im not talking about hitting his friend in the face with a lot and im not talking about that total nonsense about them into a stomach and the belt safety ok ok im not talking about those shoes i said im not gonna mention them tonight should just disregard track you tell you before jewellery in the judges please disregard oh ok will do so so what happens what happens is kasich commercial but he only put up the first part he doesnt put up the second about all the people in the united states take take little slip it sees a horrible people horrible people interesting linda st paul not that i care about patients i think hes got one percent but it says cases does the worst you know its funny when people come after me theyve gone down the tubes you look at cases each now before that jindal he was vicious bobby jindal alfred e newman i column he was he was so vicious whos gonna have to be a set i dont even know this guy and then yet perry the nations guy from texas a problem one of the worst debate performances in the history of debates i was the debate performance you can never ever lived down but all of a sudden he became vicious he goes to washington make a major speech on me because it wanted to pick up he goes to lindsey graham i mean this cool guy now the poor guy take it easy usa and its south carolina i was at of and he was a true three and hes just sitting senator how bad florida florida in flood out i met very high numbers and a governor bush i mean honestly so many commercials i cant watch it he spent millions and millions of dollars spent nothing i havent done a commercial i actually felt badly now i actually felt badly i did a radio commercial a small one because the pressure is killing me why do you do more commercials whyyy said i dont need it but we gotta do a commercial so we did actually pretty good radio commercial gonna be doing a lot of commercials actually i think i think actually were gonna be doing most of the commercials that have somebody hits me im gonna hit them back show heart which is what we should be doing with isis and everybody else these people that are pouring in the back they dont know what theyre missing do they dont know so so so many things but lindsey graham disaster perry disaster all like disasters think of this as a friend of mine said you know so far thats a christian hasnt hit me yet he will he has to his no choice he said hes gonna hit me at some point rubios gotta hit be hey theres only one way you get to the top of her talk through trump lets face it they have to they have i think hes been showing support everything i said he supported every single thing i said hes been so supportive but its employees gonna have to hit me right gonna be a sad day but we will hit back i promise i promise but you look at whats going on and you look at the world and you see whats happening and we have to get this right we can put a stiff we cant put a lowenergy person we can put peoples home ive gotten to know some of whom i respect some of whom i really dont respect some of whom i dont respect i look at some of the people that are on the day as i never debated before now in all fairness every online poll drugs used terrific hes a terrific guy by the way drudge but dredges a big poll hundreds of thousands of people died after the debate time agassi im a just on the cover of time magazine believe me other than that i have no power over time magazine time magazine way they all do these poses like five or six so we have the debates every single debate and believe me hundreds of thousands i am not telling people to make phone calls all right and online poll which i think are actually better in many respects and when they interview people in the show you one day i dont understand people i do understand people but i dont understand why the interview point three point three is the baby ok so i never understood that but you know what whatever it too i took that the wharton school of finance i took that whole thing and it never made sense to me but i guess it works crews usually that right or row in the last number of elections theyve been wrong i hope theyre right right i want to be right i gotta be right but you look at these phones and in the debates i want all the debates and im saying to myself today cnn im coming over and i told you i had this great pastors meeting is great great meal took the camera just from cnn they know me i love i love hitting damn well the cameras are not level i love so cnn gave me the story it was like a meeting never even took place and it was such a great it was like a love fest and i said thats really unfair stuff so maybe how would you like to do this box for the first of eight up with to million people one of the largest in the history of cable may be the largest in the history of cable cnn at million people it was the biggest show in the history of cnn this isnt me this is from ok the biggest ratings in the history of cnn biggest they cover wars that cover the discover how about the next debate is with cnn now you have to tell me cause i know what they have to say old trip is chicken ok how about i tell cnn who doesnt treat me properly they dont they just right they really dont have a lot of respect for some of the people over there but they dont trip how about i tell cnn that im not gonna do the next day i tell you the problem you know we just got this is a nice thing when youre really smart like really really really smart like i am extemporaneously so i dont need teleprompters ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen thank you very much you know how easy that is you read for a half hour and i talked for an hour and a half and i dont have any of that stuff but the nice thing is you can be very current generating a speech and you have to get speechwriters to change i mean i i hear things on the airplane coming over we can talk about it but how about we do this was saying i wont do the debate unless they pay me five million dollars all of which money goes to the wounded warriors or go to that i would love to let me give you the bad so what will happen is theyll settle trump is check and let them for of a man according to every online poll i want every one of them now when i turn on the television and i listen to these you know the talking heads who are not smart people at all my education to better than any of them im smarter than they are many of the people know many of the people in the room were smarter they are but the talking heads i could name them but actually a couple of her actually starting to come around so i gotta be careful i cant set of all the way back again right but you got guys like karo he spends hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign she wins not say he wants nothing there are some people that are losers ok but how about if we do the other losses and losses and and thats the prob we cant have that we cant have that with the republican party have to get the right people and we have to win thats why when i show you this is paul its a foxhole would be hillary thats what we have to have a number i havent even started on hillary yet other than i do say no strength stamina but with cnn so i say five million dollars goes to the wounded warrior warriors and the vet ok do it like that were winning by a lot i say we could do a lot of people say they say it over here trips crowd was packed we havent had a new look at every mark cuban called up you want to use my career at the dallas mavericks i said what day is it thursday when can i use it monday asset for days how many seats twenty thousand seats we felt it up like a day and a half and he predicted that he knows theres a feeling by the way there is a feeling but heres the problem so were leaving in everything the biggest crowds by sparks so much bigger than bernie said you know about birdies and a crowd may he rest in fish you know we had an operation today i think it was a hernia operation you know you know why carrying around too much tax problems says hes gonna tax you hes going to track shoe but lets not even talk he wants to double or triple everyone that wants to bring you up to ninety percent and he wants to bring you because he wants to take know what happened is yellow in now has gone way out and she wants to give everybody free everything except for the people that pay taxes you know somebody has to pay somebody else so its gotta be late but heres the problem so we cnn i said no im not doing it their ratings will go down where they would be you know lets say they would have had a million people when they have maybe two million people and they have million people the case of fox so theyre expecting a lot a bigger audience this number advertising it all of what i do like they finally used a beautiful picture of me sometimes the pictures are so bad they have my chin pull back so i look like quadruple chins they picked the worst but they picked a good picture of so happy with them i actually wrote him a letter saying thank you for the first time in about to use but heres what happens i want five million dollars they were getting for a second ad for the last thing they went from four thousand dollars to approximately two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for thats a lot of money and then if you remember cnbc extended by one hour two days before the united nations extending it will make it a fortune that would totally sold out and who is the one that said no way youre not gonna do it i did not because i could stand up there forever but i said youre not gonna do it and everybody can be everybody this is like to walk believe me were gonna build a wall mexicos good effect to pay for the war so when i get this receive nbc to make it three hours i should number one i can send up here for hours i can send up to date i dont care who the hell wants to watch the same questions over and over and over again like for twoandahalf three hours so i said no way and i said when i could do it no fairness carson joined in with me he said absolutely ill go wrong and they fold it in about two seconds thats supposed to be the business network they fall to quick quick they folded so were cnn historical say chicken hes afraid to debate hes afraid to debate than what i dont just talk to korean hope that all of my people i said id love to watch this story on the past it was so terrible it was done by reporters sitting right back there away by the way she wasnt even there she wasnt in trump tower that out of beautiful news conference with all these pastors and was like we didnt do anything i wont mention a name i dont wanna make her more famous and shes not very famous but but such such a such a disgusting report so proud robbinsdale say that trump is chicken now if youre not bleeding and you going nowhere yet nothing to lose but wouldnt it be better im leading the polls i dont do it id like you to write it gets out of chicken which im not one thing im not just checking every remember every single i want every single pole in the debates all four debates check it folks you know i only said what should i say anything thats even slightly off the next headlines every single poll but if i do this it could be hes playing too cute and maybe i dont do well and maybe my real polls which of the polls were leading by so much maybe they go down so should i tell cnn that im not doing the debate because they treat me really unfairly and shape but i will do it if you give five million dollars to the vets wow i know the people in this room good and if they covered by her remarks good but they dont want to just cover tiny bit they wont mention what i just get so they gave you like three seconds of this if i do it i have a feeling i could face repercussions in the polls should i do if i dont i dont know if i want to take the chance i dont know you know its a little like ok we are to the right one of the great i love you so much for that came up one to do the offences show became a tremendous tremendous hit and and by the way the head of contest was a great guy steeper came to my office just before announced he wanted to renew for a lot of money ill pay whatever wanted to renew at i succeed i think im gonna run i wasnt sure until i got down the escalator with my beautiful wife waving but shes waving and im saying oh yeah yeah i gotta do this the bottom of this massive area was you couldnt even see any of the marble because it was so many cameras on it and i took a deep breath and i went and i get it and i and by the way and that speech we announced illegal immigration we announce the whole thing as it turned out to be a very very big deal a very very big deal right very big so will the wall so so what happens so what happens with the apprentice we went on and didnt have an option because everybody said while trumpeting adobe is not a television so they did a oneseason deal without an option very unusual didnt want to waste the ink and critics said why would anybody want to watch the apprentice with donald trump and then they said the worst insult ever had this one critic a total moron chet women will never let you know what lets women watch a show it can be successful as women make up a big part of the audience said unless you have big women and you just cant the people on television know that and is one guy said why would women ever wanna watch donald trump intelligence you believe this is when it first came out show a very insulting fact i said to my wife and my that bad dialing am i that bad and i should have been fine but the show and it starts at number agosto number eighty goes to number five anyway many evenings the number one show and tell became this phenomenon and so what happened check because they didnt have an option so what happened is she came to me and i read all about friends where they made two million dollars an episode and it will how many of them five or something right jennifer aniston all of them and they had like a union but they made a lot of money per episode i would not form that union if i would jennifer maybe i would have asked for more but thats okay shes a team player so what happens what happens i should i know nothing my agent told me dont do the apprentice in the first place not gonna work so i fired him i said you know the show just went to number one night fire at my age so im stuck without a date but i we thought about these ridiculous hours at these television stars and i asked for a tremendous celery should look i have the hottest show on television you remember that shes in one particular the final episode i think was second after the superbowl had tremendous numbers of people watching it and i said i dont do this myself i dont this just two simple and so yes for a crazy number and they should know they turn me down and i said man i just blew it and two days later they called me back well give it to you ok and i said why they paid me for you saw the money i made on the apprentice a defile and how much was it two hundred and thirteen million dollars you believe that nobody believes i dont believe it i mean to be honest i had a file in the file myself and everybody should run maybe hes not as big as people think and you know whats gonna happen and he wont file well i thought and i was much bigger and by the way i dont say that bigger better stronger low debt tremendous cash flow numbers that i would ever believe even fifteen years ago i just a great company the reason i say that is it for ego its because this is the mentality this is the thinking that we need for our country to make us great just to finish and then were going to get back onto that but just to finish i said to the head of nbc why did you fold as i love this as you know i love to know why did people fold like a little people that why did they followed so i said why did you fall he said you know we want and we started interviewing other people but in the end we didnt want to take a chance ok and its the same thing with us its the same thing with us we are going to do something so strong and so bold but we cant take a chance and picked the wrong president we cant pick a woman who was totally embroiled in scandal for her home life whitewater dont think of it whitewater whitewater was no different everybody that study that they did a book on it she should have been indicted she should have been indicted how bad was the the cattle futures the cattle futures right where numbers went up like she made a massive amount of money in like one week and guys do this professionally all their lives if that the whole thing the whole thing is a scandal the whole thing is corrupt its corrupt and it has been you look at the foundation you look at everything its been so bad for so long we cant do that we can get involved in that stuff anymore and honestly its true shell say hello to people she disappeared for five days i dont disappear for five days tomorrow im going someplace all the time the time im going we need tremendous stamina we need tremendous strength and this is women men you know what we need strength training and we need smart just a tough person cuz i know tough guys i know it tough guy people and stuff is no good tough is no good without the brain power you need to brain you need the brain but we need to toughness to we need general patton we need general i mean our armed services today are so politically correct that a guy like general patton who is a vicious rules list horrendous human being who christ and its still in peoples faces who cares he was great by the way his troops his troops would go to hell for him his troops would go to help mad dog his troops would go to hell for him or we need general douglas macarthur into history of less one of the greatest intellect and he was a totally different type but he was a guy that only understood winning thats what he understood we dont need these guys that i see on television all the time talking about is very true i there sixty thousand people we got him through harbor planning tolerable planning that whole thing with iraq again gotta be given points i said in dont go out and now i am by far and we have a lot of that shy love you i love him lot of that we had a lot of action this room and were going to take care of our vet we are going to really take care of our bed you know we put in a plan recently were going to take care of it but we have to have people that dont talk we dont want talkers we want to ours we want people that know whats happening i see on television all these generals theyre talking about yes well what did we do this i see a couple of weeks ago we all go through send fifty men and then he said why would a president i didnt say i didnt say that god had said again but louder mary radeva treated george are you heard what i said well theres something going on because some of these decisions are hard to believe so he announces that hes sending fifty minutes and maybe someone i dont know but he sending fifty people over a fineness why would why would you say that because now theyre being hunted now theyve got target on their back now the enemy knows it going over there why would you say that theyre being hunted like like wild dogs theyre being hunted why would you say that you sending fifty people and its you know the address they think its not even good psychologically cuz is not the number i mean you know fifty people so its not even get from that standpoint its not like were sending a hundred thousand people go fifty people that probably say wow were number one were going to get those fifty of with the enemy right number one were going to get there and were gonna make them look real bad and number two just two people ok if you gonna do it either do it or dont do it but you have to either do it or you dont do this strategy their strategy is totally wrong so i write the book the american way deserves a you saw that right did you see the book does anybody have that book the american wages in the year two thousand and i talked about osama bin laden because he was a terrorist with a big fat mouth and he was going around saying the destruction hes gonna do and i say i said in the book two years before the world trade center came down you better do something about this guy osama bin laden i said something nobodys gonna crawl into iraq and come back and a couple of people actually called osama he did he came back to knock down the world trade center with thousands and thousands of lives and people still dying and families still suffering because they lost people this was the worst attack this was worse to pearl harbor caused at least that was an attack on the military this was an attack on innocent people working in an office and having lunch up on top of the world this was an attack on civilians were stacking attack in the history of the country and we could have done something about it we could have done something if we had two leaders if we had smart people could have done something about that osama bin laden was out there i read about them in my book he was out there you dont go out and say were sending fifty men his another push a war should have been studying to destabilize the home at least thats what happened and i said it reuters has a big article on top trump says totally against the wall not because i would be against but because you have to know im gonna build a military so strong so powerful so great that will never have to use it whenever gonna have to use it we dont want to use we dont want to use it in many ways in many ways the military is and building it up is the cheapest thing we can do because its like the tough guy you never really want to go against a tough you know you get the test we grow up and we all know what were talking about but the tough guy well hopefully im distraught we have to have cunning we have to have guile we have to have a lot of different qualities but we cant keep going with these all talk no action politicians who are paid off by the impact that paid off by the packs they controlled like little puppet state theyre packed we cant keep going like this we all trillion thats now going to be trillion dollars its a number that appeared at a number that you would have even thought this is possible chinas ripping us on trade japan is killing us on trade with china were losing four hundred and fifty billion dollars on an imbalance a year with japan is seventy billion dollars a year mexico story fight thats why i know people say i told you before i said you know why because then they can afford to mexico all of the mexican people i respect mexico i respected leaders but their leaders just so much smarter than our leaders you send mexico one extra day there five soldiers out of the country and yet they send everybody over the data want people go through mexico keep going the dummies in the united states a womans pregnant she has a baby steps over the border she has a baby its an american citizen we take care of the baby for any time no more and i attack that anchor babies i attacked and i attacked its strength and it turned out it was right i didnt even know that at the time because everybody said all of these dumbass politicians said oh no ono they are they good one thing ill tell you what theyre good at one thing getting reelected i mean i had to deal with a guy like a siege discuss nothing these people these are people that should not be on this stage these are people its an embarrassment to have some of them in the safe and some are very good ill be honest im not gonna tell you who dont want you to vote for me but theres something very good but there is some dutch if not beyond the stage when you have a guy like pataki he doesnt even register in certain areas we have to register and hes gonna be back on the stage of the republican party and if somebodys not registered lets say in virginia or lets say in south carolina because they dont want to pay the fee because they cant get some signatures on a ballot and you cant register because is now the time limit so you dont have south carolina are you have been jigna youre not gonna be on the debate stage with us but they dont do anything about it they dont do anything about it so we have to get tougher we have to get smarter we have to really run this country with love and with heart and we have to take care of people that are sick and we have to take care of people that need help we have to get better health care obamacare is a disaster obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced with something so much better so much i dont know i dont know if you saw recently where premiums are going up percent people can afford them the coverage is horrible the deductable just so high that unless youre dead you can use it ok you can use it as useless as usual its terrible and it was all a big lie times you can have your doctor you can have your plan you can have whatever you want and frankly the democratic it appeared that fresh because i dont have you been reading the papers lately but obamacares in big big trouble potential trouble they have to be bailed out big league by congress they could have to be bailed out big big leak in fletcher leaving have a new president im going to these problems to fix but i think some belief but heres the problem the democrats at least we know where theyre coming from these republicans we send them to washington and i support him i give a lot of money but we send them to washington and they get down there and they dont do the job that they cant paint or they should women and obamacare right i dont know if you have any of this area probably you do we get into obamacare within to do this were going to strengthen up here were gonna take care of our vets went to take care of us they talk and they talk now they get down to these gorgeous holes with a beautiful marble columns and the angels on the ceiling and look at this way we finally hit the big time do we fight and it comes to a vote on obamacare everybody raises i mean look at this last budget this last budget was approved so fast and we have to raise two trillion dollars because of this budget when you do the budget you supposed to start the following morning when negotiating because youre not have enough time then they should close down government everybodys afraid of closing down the government and you know the funny thing i want the art of the deal the funny thing is that nobodys gonna blame me blame for closing down the government but obama when people read the history books not gonna say better throws down nobodys gonna know boehner is gonna say during the obama administration the government closed down he was a hard but president theyre gonna say he was a hot president he didnt know what the hell he was doing he was a tremendous divided because hes the most divisive human being i think ive ever seen and the one thing a lot of us thought including me i said you know what hes not going to be good but you know he will unify perhaps the country and hell bring white and africanamerican and everybody who bring them all together and you know what that turned out to be totally wrong its never been worse when i met today with the africanamerican pastors never been worse than it is today and likely if you are africanamerican youth to percent unemployed i mean everything to me it has been a horrible president has been horrible to a point where people that would never vote republican come up to my office and they want to really talk turkey and its hard for them to always go democrat and its hard for them but they come up to my office because they really want help so hes been a great divider hes been an incompetent president everything he touches turns to you no wat everything they give it we dont have victories anymore right we dont have the whens the last time we had a victory we dont have victories anymore i healthcare is no good its a disaster our trade with all of these countries is no good our borders are like says people are just pouring in we have sanctuary cities which by the way will end very quickly ok when i made a speech in trump tower that im gonna run and i gave up a lot i gave up a lot because what i gave up is far more than any campaign is going to cause im talking now in dollars i gave up a tremendous amount including shows everything but i gave up a lot you know a politician a politician gives up nothing they run they lose they win they run again totally controlled by their donors by special interests and by lobbyists totally and theres a story and i have to tell you positions like and ive been saying it for a long time i think we had either nine or super pacs formed for me jump super pac one of those the art of the deal packed the art of the deal so people give money get all these and a lot of these people that form the super pac have no money maybe ill give you a good idea right you go former super pac keep all the money for yourself so im saying to myself i would do when people send to the art of the deal super they probably think im running but were not supposed to run it im not running it and i see these two young guys on television and i see others and there are talking about the ship nothing to do with it we sent legal letters to close your doors closed up i would have had hundreds of millions of dollars if i wanted to have a super pac and if i wanted to have other people fund my campaign i dont want other people to find my i dot because nobody knows the game better than me we take the small contributions because i have to i mean i have people sending me and you have to let those are people that are in love with this country and you have to take the ball like contributions but these are people that really want to invest in this country the greatness of the country i try to send the money back would cost more than some of the checks to come in you wouldnt even know and theres no letter i can write to a woman who said in with a four page letter four page letter so proud that she said this month is no letter that i could write when shes not insulted i have turned down tens of millions of dollars and you know most of those guys have gone to other campaigns because they want to i mean that like horse players in a certain way but they also want taxes and they want power and i said i dont wanna take your money im not gonna take your money so has our story was just on the front page of the los angeles time times a super pac called american legacy raised six million dollars now this is i guess its a carson or carsick oriented only one hundred and forty thousand dollars was left for the campaign now but this is the same with roche maybe not as bad as the same with rubio its the same with all of my guess maybe a couple of them do it properly but the consultants and the fundraisers and all of these people they take the money theyre professionals they make money better than being a real estate broker to be honest with you i mean ill probably give a lot of people in the audience an idea but its better than being a real estate broker so thick of it jeb bush jeff hes hes another beauty jeb bush yesterday said dont truck tried to talk tough now cuz i said hes got no energy i call them a lowenergy person so now he wants to be a tough guy doesnt work you cant be tough enough you know whether he should be himself if he should help it do better cant do any worse but jet version of the day said donald trump doesnt have the right tone to be present the tone and i said to my who cares right so his soda chopping off peoples heads in the middle east theyre drowning people in cages were like living in medieval times we cant wait to board they asked me the other day just ahead and what are the announces asked me the other day one of the talking heads actually said what do you think of waterboarding well you wanna go a step further than waterboarding cuz im ok with that too everybodys heads every day you see james foley great parents i made a contribution to the people and the parents and i they did the foley foundation and i got to know them and him and threw them and hes like he was like this great person they do is the first and i said it i think i suspect a terrible mistake when they did that they created this tremendous hatred what now theyre doing it all over the place and we havent done anything about it and we have a president that doesnt even want to mention islamic problems right now he doesnt want to mention it he doesnt want to say you know when you when you think about it he doesnt want to use the terms he doesnt wanna say what it is and you cant cure a problem if youre not gonna say what the problem is you just cant kill so we have a problem like probably there hasnt been fighting a war like weve never fought of course hes not saying its a worry that but it was fighting a war with it blowing up airplanes where theyre doing things like what you just saw paris and other places and we have a president that refuses to use proper terminology and why that is nobody can really tell me that one ok why that was this audience is amazing i wish i wish everybody i wish everybody can hear you know when you think of the radical right radical muslim rather anything you want to say but its a problem and its a problem that has to be addressed whether its where islamic extremists or not you have to say what it is and thats what it is thats why there is even a soccer game recently you saw that the other day without a soccer game ahead of a dead one minute of silence for the people that were just absolutely bludgeoned absolutely what they did in paris and people yelling things from the audience things that werent supposed to happen and the players were unbelievably embarrassed that it was a great embarrassment that you dont get a lot of reporting on it but it was a most of you have heard about it that was last week so we need strength we need power we need smarts were gonna redo this country were gonna make it better than its ever been before i really believe that i really believe i really i really the other day i read on the headline of one of the newspapers the number of migrants crossing the rio grande is through the roof you know weve been here not well its not tremendous increase the number of migrants crossing the rio grande our country has no borders if you dont have borders you dont have a country im sorry im sorry im sorry provided at the base of trump tower new york if i didnt talk about illegal immigration i dont even think youd be talking about it right now you had cake in san francisco you had jim muir this young incredible guy there was gonna go to the football player a good student his father ive gotten to know him and an unbelievable man and his son was shot and killed walking home with us in which his father from the deli he was going to go on a scholarship to one of the great colleges maybe stamford on a football scholarship the apple of the fathers and he called up his father and he said papi called them ill be home in a couple of minutes im right outside ive got your sandwich and then a minute later jameel senior heard three or four gunshots rang out and he knew he knew this was a guy that walked up to his son held a gun to his head and pulled the trigger right through the head and when the boy went down he went like this and he shot him again and blew his hands off and illegal immigrant they came over the same thing in los angeles a few weeks ago a woman year old veteran raped sodomized and killed by an illegal weve gotta get our country back from weve got to get in and by the way either way these three instances there are thousands and thousands and thousands its its horrible at the border patrol i was over there not long ago the rate of texas and the border patrol these are great people and their sit down stand down they cant do the job theyre not allowed to do this and people are pouring into the country and now we have syrians that look awfully strong now cant do it and you know what im all for abroad for building safe zones in syria which and i have employees from legally here by the way all have i been tested i have these guys going to reporters everyplace have i been tested but i have maybe somebody sticks and believe me youll find it if they do but i have from all over but you know its funny they come from countries that you wouldnt think much you would never think that youd want to go there big ambition is to make money here and go back to their country they want to go back to the country and i understand that i understand that they want to go home you want to be back with their mothers and fathers and their soil and their plants even if the plant is not the kind of plant that you like they want to go home to the country and i understand that and the fact is if you build shapes jones and boyd you have plenty of land over there but if you build safe zones and you gotta get the gulf states as an example saudi arabia billion today now that was a couple of months ago when i was a half a billion dollars a day so much money they dont know what to do wonderful people that treat me nicely by my apartment i love them ok but you know what the money is enormous we dont have money weve got to get them to put up money we defend that we defend germany we defend japan we defend his career there right next to the maniac escapism mania we have soldiers we defended give us like nothing if you wanna buy a television lg samsung shop they have come thousands and thousands of televisions in the last year for different projects right can you believe im running parttime like running parttime im doing well for parttimers right by the way talking about so wouldnt it be nice ive spent less money in my campaign than anybody else and im in first place every one that be nice if the country could do the same thing example officials said you know i have to spend more money it doesnt look that good i havent done that and then somebody said to me you know what really is great but nobody but i ever heard of charles openly he owned the oakland as right he had the lowest payroll in baseball and he won the world series three times in a row he had a young lady jacks the young catfish hunter and george tavern it was one of my best friends and a great guy but he used to just by his players all the time and george tell me this guys a genius he had the lowest payroll in baseball and he won the world series three times and its all his players for fortune and replace it with guys are just as good of our country could run like the people in this room following us to remember what ive been saying attacked the oil right ive been saying that now for four years but i say i say tactical and then keep these guys attack it but they dont want to keep it consistent so for years ive been saying attack attack the world of ice attack and they all said that would be ridiculous obama actually had one of his general say well that wouldnt be a good military i said wait a minute im making much of their money from oil to make it a lot from banking and who knows better about attacking banks and i do im one of the alltime lows of history ok getting attacked the banks money is pouring in from illegally money is pouring in and the banks will stop it because i know how i know the games these politicians dont know anything but ive been saying attacked you attacked that doesnt make sense thats not a good strategy i actually heard the other day that attack into a bad idea because its environmentally not sensitive can you believe smoke and a lot of do it for environmental reasons can you believe the incredible and competence ok adventure that that is a serious consideration as to why that in a tactic just to show you how its stupid our leaders and these people want to kill all of us so i been sayin attack vol well after paris and right at powers finally and it was france can you believe it would strengthen the attack which im happy about what they finally started attacking the ul and only one person back there said you know that was trumps idea long time ago hes been saying it every time i every chance i got what i said one other thing i should attack going recapture get exxonmobil get a couple of these great companies will rebuild the infrastructure dole about the infrastructure these companies are amazing half of you probably work theyre amazing companies they will rebuild it so fast to build a new and nice will ensure that will make a fortune and will give a percentage of that money to the families of the soldiers of iraq and other places that worked and chilled badly wounded will give a percentage in that money to the wounded warriors i will take care of people but these guys dont want to do you know in the old days to the victim you know your military man i could see it stands up straight great guy but i can see it to the victim along the spoils right we dont do it we dont do that we can involve a lot of places when wind and we live and how got it just about but how about this one when he get the exact date when were pulling ok how bout that it must be some kind of a game i thought maybe hes playing the game that he didnt mean it because he doesnt mean itll get them by surprise see our country needs the world unpredictable were totally predictable he announces he announced next week will be bombing of certain city in the meantime it turns out to be hell on wheels because its so prepared because whatever he says sent out to be right gets it could be leading up so what happens is that obama comes out and he should we leaving iraq so what happens and believe me i want to be killed you know you read all about to go and they dont wanna be killed so they put that how stupid is he hes told us when hes leaving but we have to fight for their leaving soon so they pull back and we think were doing great and by the way i came because we had no control over the people that took over iraq they wouldnt let i should have their fair share a year and what happened as i just became more issues by far than them and more vicious that saddam hussein by the way who didnt have weapons of mass destruction so what happened so what happens is we have a president that told them the exact day that were pulling out now you tell me how stupid is that and now they have and now they have a war going on where they dont know what theyre doing theyre fighting syria but serious fighting i should and theyre fighting together so were fighting and were also saying wow i cant believe it the united states whos fighting us is killing our worst enemy houses we love the united states and shot down the side at russia and because we gave a hundred and fifty billion dollars we dont get our prisoners window got up to go into it may be the worst deal ever made everything ive ever seen of any kind so now were hiding around potentially fighting reischauer were fighting i said i was fighting serious serious we dont know what the hell with their word we have stupid people you cant fight and got a picture you got a picky guy and i tell you i pick a shot as a bad guy were backing the rebels just like we did you know their place ok were back in the rebels to go in now the rebels are ices and some people think the rebels are far worse so were back in the rebels look what happened in libya look what happened in iraq we dont that people and we get more equipment and oneshots dried up in the air and all our equipment is in the hands of the enemy this stuff is going to happen if every single ball that could happen every single policy number one by far and leadership not saying leader on the im just telling you ill be a great leader but every single call you know somebody would win thats why he was a leader if its somebody for the packers lost all the time he would have been a leader ok telecheck hes a great guy but the only way you can be a winner you cant be a loser and be a leader you cant doesnt work because you may get away with it for a little while but eventually people say we we keep losing we want somebody is going to win i win i win i know how to win just like now were driving the republican establishment craze and the reason theyre going crazy is because they want to have their puppets and im not a puppet and one for you know which moved to mexico when they call me im gonna do whats right for you im not gonna do whats right for me cause i dont care and im not gonna do it right because they were fundraises and they gave me a lot of money and when the best go or just moved its big plant to mexico want something to show for all that good stuff ok and when the fundraisers and the lobbyists and the special addressing me about nabisco im gonna do whats right for you so really in a nutshell its been great being with you tonight its like this all over its like the enthusiasm of the incredible everything its its like this all over we have an amazing country of people that really want to see us great again the expression make america great again i mean they really want to see it we have to get out and vote dont believe all this stuff i think im gonna win the hispanic vote and i frankly dont think it matters you know the fact is that if the republicans got up and voted last time you would have had a different president of you know romney let us down he let us down and he didnt energize the base people were saying i dont care i mean if you dont care between obama and romney thats not doing a good job weve gotta get out weve gotta be energy if you have a broken leg a broken back and broken neck you have to get up and you have to vote youve gotta go out and and ill tell you this and i say theres even more strongly now than ever before ive gotten to know so many people on the trail our country is made up of believable people and spirit our country with proper leadership and ill give you really proper were gonna have fun were going to have victories were gonna win were gonna win so much were going to do things were going to be with you to take care of our people that needed which republicans arent ever get credit for and we didnt do that we have to do that otherwise i wouldnt even run for office were gonna have a big beautiful heart but were going to make this country not only great again were gonna make our country greater than its ever been before and we can do it thank you thank you i love you i love you thank you very much thank youthank you all over this happens if its ok id like to have a moment of silence for the victims of the paris attacks please whats going on and when you look at what happened in that case reported one from syria president wants to take in two hundred and fifty thousand from syria think of a two hundred and fifty thousand people and we all have hard and we all want people taking care of it all of that with the problems our country has to take in two hundred and fifty thousand people some of whom are going to have problems big problems is just insane we have to be insane terrible and when you look at paris you know the toughest gun laws in the world paris nobody had guns but the bad guys nobody nobody had guns and there are you shooting them one by one and then they broke in and had a big shootout and ultimately killed the terrorists and ill tell you what you can say what you want but if they had guns if our people had guns if they were allowed to carry it would have been a much much different situation i hear it all the time you look at certain cities that have the highest violence the highest highest problem with guns and shootings and killings chicago as an example toughest gun laws in the united states nothing but problems so our country but he gets part because were not smart great now and i dont know if you noticed but for two years ive been saying bomb the oil fields because thats the source of their well thats the source of their well for two years weve been saying it bombed the oil fields and its such a disgrace so yesterday they started everyone showed us a terrible thing that trump said hes so hard i always say jeb bush would say my tone might own its unbelievable the other day i made a speech that people in iowa they loved the speech they loved it and i talked about the deficiencies of some of the candidates and the newspaper said it was ranting raving i dont read that he was so horrible in terms of what he said about a day said the truth i didnt say anything in one case i said what that particular person wrote about himself true and they said he was so harsh it was a terrible thing is i said what he wrote about himself its incredible how dishonest the presses its incredible absolutely and i wanted to know whether to be talking about the wall because were gonna build a wall is going to be a big wall i was gonna look beautiful someday theyll probably end up naming it the trump wallets gotta look beautiful come through the openings and theyll come in and theyre gonna come in legally entire country and thats what we want people that are here illegally are going to have to go and you know what someday theyll come back and theyll come back through the legal process and thats what we all want and i just want to bring something very very special people on stage but i just want to say that when i announced that i was going to run for president i made some statements that were very strong but very true i talked about illegal immigration and i took a lot of heat that first two weeks and then people found out i was right and i will tell you its become a very big subject in this country its costing us two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year nobody knows that nobody talks about that will talk about china will talk about trade will talk about a lot of things later but its going to guess at least two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year tremendous problems tremendous crime tremendous crime and nobody disputes when i said if they also known as terrible tremendous growth and you know what and were gonna have a country were gonna have a car and we want you not to do and these people are walking is standing down there holding their weapons holding everything theyre amazing men and women stand down people walk right into the country and you know in other countries you cant do that by the way in mexico and i i love mexicans great place to have strong leadership smart leaders damn smart people if you want to become a citizen of mexico its the hardest country in the world just about to become a citizen but over here come on in were a bunch of dopes come on come on come on you know the whole thing about the anchor babies yeah shes pregnant walks into the united states has the baby we take care of the baby for the next so not gonna happen and i was right about it fourteenth amendment doesnt say that you will have a baby the baby to sustain and they said all you did a whole new constitutional amendment would take years and years it could never be cut you dont need that you know that i turned out to be right the great legal scholars have said hes so you dont need but before we go further i i just met these people backstage and theyve been very nice to me because ive been very nice to them because ive been saying whats been going on and there are many others that ive met this is a few the remembrance project where peoples loved ones were killed by illegal immigrants people that we have violently killed one of the men i became sort of a friend of his jameel he had a son young football player good who is black to stanford quarterback great kid never had a problem in his life a great young man and he went to the deli and he came back home and he was violently shot in the head many times and his father heard the shots outside where the saddest is that he told the story was talking to my boy and my boy said ill be home in five minutes bob sandwich from the deli and hes walking home and the father jamiel shaw the father heard shots right outside and it was a guy shooting his son in the head and then his son laying on the ground is like this and he shot him through the hand with which is obliterated his hands everything killed instantly and the father lay down to the sidewalk couldnt believe what happened couldnt believe it said this could nap and hes just a great guy and hes not here today but other people are and i just like to bring them the remembrance project these are amazing people coming up states folks we cant have this anymore we just like this where its being run like the way its being so cute boy thank you mister dropped my name is laura wilkinson josh was a team he was asked for a ride home by someone we gonna let it was illegal he beat him in the head of the closet rod who strangled him let him go trying to let him go he kicked him in the stomach so hard that its wise to spleen into in africa father murdered him tied him up like an animal grooming of buildings on fire its something you dont want to live through the list goes on and on thank you mister truck for bringing it out in the medias finally picked up on it happened everything all day every day i wanna so just one thing dont forget brandon mendoza dominic durden andrew rosenberg theyre not here today but then theres a long list of names thank you hi gerry ruiz and my husband and i this is our daughter felicia he was murdered money and he was ambushed beaten her throat was cut and she was dead over times and we had been years trying to get her fugitive hes hiding in venezuela we know that much and they refused to let us have him they know hes wanted for murder united states we just hope that someday the youths marshals will be able to bring him out marshall cameron will to the martial artists case and if you know we just want justice for daughters so im a little nervous but we need the link someone like mister truck for president so in venezuela get going to do just fine with venezuela if i win if i win we will get him out fast from the police catch him we did have a trial but serving two years probation my name is dan jovic on the father of spencer go show my son years old january st this year he was sitting at a red light in the neighborhood that i grew up in an illegal alien from mexico that it been deported four times a day rap she included felonies assaults and burglaries and had been in our federal prison system for five and a half years ago that two red light randomly pick my son out his brains out shot for more people this is a result of politically correct they will they will they they have no problem sacrificing your loved one your child for the advancement of their own little agenda but they they they will pc into the ground and i think mr trump standing up and saying things that need to be said that no one else the same you dont see that you dont read about in the papers about it you dont see it its just unbelievable and i see it all the time wherever i go because im the only one that talks about it its like deficit soared to watch its devastating and you can imagine for no reason and theres so many more i mean i have met so many families friends with some of them and you just say how could it happen the sanctuary city stuff is just unbelievable unbelievable its unbelievable that we can allow it to happen in this country is unbelievable you look at san francisco with kate same thing shot in the back and five times they threw this guy out of mexico my opinion they threw a matter of mexico city mexico they say hey the us doesnt know what its doing will send him over there so the fifth so the fifth it well or do something very strong term in this case because you know case law case loads a good thing they cant even get it passed they probably wont get it passed and its its a tough thing i see so much of it i see so much of it because wherever i go i i wana meet the people and devastated their lives are ruined hopefully not but you see it its its a very it would be easy to say oh its going to be fine what time its done one of the parents said to me was ten years and one of the parents had to beat worse now than it was years ago so you know the time thing that we all say we always like to say i dont think it really works but its something that were going to do something about that if i win believe me were gonna do something about it were going to do something all right lets talk about a little more pleasant situation because we have so much negative news you know i wrote the new book right crippled america and i picked the worst possible picture myself it was terrible but what are you gonna zaid scribbled america and it is we have a president he just came out yourself what hed said he made a little saving i want to say it exactly as he said it because you know what i have such a good memory and only that but he said we have i saw given notice yet he says isil ive always said i say i like it i dont know what else is isolate think he does that too maybe who knows maybe hes one of the few i say i since everyone seems to say i says he says i sold but he said we have isil contained now this was yesterday a few hours before the attack where you had plenty of americans involved in that too in terms of the big involved on the injuries and worse than that but we have i selfcontained we have leadership that doesnt know what theyre doing folks we have leadership that doesnt know what theyre doing and we have to change we have to go back we have to go back to where we used to be years ago when we were strong and powerful and people respected as said and when you had a sergeant bergdahl whos a trader he was shot for being a traitor hes gonna get nothing and we trade sergeant bergdahl of the biggest killers that they want right now back on the battlefields the back on the battlefields we have to go back you have to go back in time a little bit you know some people tell you going in the wrong direction and what are the folks mention the words politically correct its true its true you know that in terms of remembrance fund when i was with a group of about two months ago when they heard that one of their sons were shot and killed instantaneously the police who i love the police have the greatest with the police so much empower their powers been taken away and thats why you have the problems and so many of the inner cities and so many that the but they can stop it but their powers been so take it away their day jobs are afraid they cant even talk to people anymore can even talk to people but i was with them and they said to me everybody was so great they were helping me helping me helping me and when they found out it was an illegal immigrant everything stuff didnt want to get involved in solving the crime once they found out who it was and they couldnt do this day they cant get people involved in other words its different if you shot somebody review shots of the go ahead i mean they give you that stuff but they found out it was an illegal immigrants in the mid and i i dented research and its so tough the system is so tough and so against law enforcement that when they find out situations like the people that just came up when they find out about it they dont pursue that like they would a regular situation with an american citizen doing the shooting or doing the killing and nobody knows why i think i know why i think probably because the process is so horrendous that they cant maybe theyre afraid to get involved because they want to keep their jobs who knows but its its very very said so were doing really well amazingly well the reuters poll yesterday came out you saw that i was great rugby greg carson had percent rubio had nine percent and crews at seven percent hes been very nice to me by the way he has there in florida trump how good is that they get that rubio is the sitting senators are made easier to extend its pretty good thats pretty good that one just came out here is what you like the best trump is leading in texas thats what you know what i also like in one of the national polls best in foreign policy they have me down and foreign policies best ok so i wrote a book the american wages and in the book it was it came out in i talked about a terrorist named osama bin laden now this is before the world trade center came down by a couple of use somebody said like eighteen months but i talked about osama bin laden in the book and one of the big moderators on one of the morning shows heard about this book what was agreed in truck was talking about a selma bin laden was before the world trade center came down he took it down it was his people wow and the guy goes wow thats amazing im really pretty good at this stuff im telling you im telling you know another thing just happened and thats the oil you know the way ive been saying go after the oil go after the other cant do that hurt the infrastructure the oil hey were in texas id seen ive seen what those companies in your companies can do in about minutes hell rebuild that infrastructure so fast with with you folks building it its a grand so fast theyll build itself fast and so good just bomb the hell out of it and so everyone said everyone said no could you know i was seeing where they get most of their money i should they get most of their money from oil from iraq some in syria so theres no you cant bomb iraq its a sovereign nation do me a favor bomb sovereign nation you know what that is sovereign nation sovereign nation that was supposed to take everyone end they didnt take everyone in they wanted to run it all themselves thats what happened thats how isis form ok thats what happened and ice has turned out to be a lot tougher than they are so they have oil and thats where they get most of their money they also get a from banking sources and boy am i gonna add banking i would come down on those sources theres theres never been a presidential candidate does banking like trump believe me they got a lot of money from bank in a lot of money through different channels of banking and you can save believing that problem can be solved quickly but i said bomb the oil take away and for two years its almost like i stop saying it because everyone was so you cant do that you cant do that why they didnt know why but they just said you cant do it so yesterday they started bombing the hell out of the aisle and i said to myself i wonder if im gonna get any credit and actually actually a number of people call jake tapper was one from cnn sort of saying wow i did what you said they should do and i had three or four big thinkers call said well i said tell me you to say to the area just saying it to me they say it to me cuz i get good ratings i want me to go in there shelly said say it on the air dont tell me so theyre doing but i actually did took it a step further if you remember i said take take take it and i said take the oil so much money take the oil dont lee we should have never gone to iraq i said that right from the beginning of cohesion you know people say trump has a very tough tone is a very tough temperament we need a tough temperament now folks we dont need a pathological temperament we need a tough time we have that but ill tell you we need a tough time but if you remember and in i said youre doing a mistake with iraq theyll be nobody tougher with military the me believe me nobody up on that stage nobody and hillary clinton has a total disaster by the way she is a disaster but you have to know when to use military so just like i wrote about osama bin laden and these all these people saying i cant believe it from the regional government could do so much talk about the bad guy you know and people were writing about him and he said hes coming into the united states is gonna do some real damage just so should not the hell out of me for it comes in that he came in and knocked down the world that could have done a job on that but they didnt but you have to know friendly guy and i probably but you know what ill tell you so you have to know what do you have to know when to do it its usually friendly the friendly ones i like to be nice to the unfriendly want to have to be a little bit tough words like so so you have to know when to use it you have to know when and the cheapest thing we can do is to build up our military and make it strong again because well never have to use it will never have to use it right now were depleted with depleted weve been fighting politically correct wars everythings politically correct we dont want to do this we dont want to do that how about this we have to be unpredictable right and i say that all the time somebody said the other day in one of those trips unpredictable thats a great compliment tell the story recently there was a story about being a business deal and i want i really beat the hell out of these people which is fine they werent very nice but they interviewed the people while ago and they said what do you think it donald trump the city so totally unpredictable and i beat them because the unpredictability now i sometimes you want to be unpredictable around reasons and you its purposely unpredictable not like you dont know what youre doing you got to be a little bit unpredictable in life and they said he beat us because we couldnt figure out hes a good poker player we couldnt figure out so heres the problem president obama announces last week we are going to send fifty troops are fineness industry area and into iraq were going to send down they leave tomorrow around hell be arriving theyll be landing at a certain airport in about hours and i should be getting off the plane so if you want to set up your military and youre everything they have a target of the hits hes fifty people have a target on this so now all over syria iraq still looking for his fifty guys at the top top top guys these are the top people that we have why does he have to say that first of all it sounds bad to say fifty sounds like so he didnt even get good publicity its sort of like either you do it dont do it right but but these are fifty of our absolute finest why does he have to say that were sending out why couldnt he just said and they go there quietly and they do their job and there are people looking because nobody knows that there is so bad he is so damn bad we shouldnt have been in iraq and i should get points division cause im the only one on the stage now im not a politician thank god is now i am but i said dont be there was a longtime reuters long time ago they said the delegation to the white house cause i was getting so much publicity on it to try and convince me i said but you know the problems you than a destabilized the middle east you have a rand in iraq that are the same in terms of strength and they fight all the time these people fight thats what they wanted to they would have fired the hell are we doing they fight a rare goes this way for years later iraq pushed in this way being back forth for decades i said if you knock out one of those elements including iran but if you look at one of those elements the other ones gonna just take over what do you do there not poker players theyre not just players anything honestly the politicians who dont know what theyre doing thats what theyre so i said dont go in and i was right about it they said weapons of mass destruction they didnt exist and saddam hussein talked about weapons of mass destruction and he boasted you know why because he wanted to scare around i made sure he didnt want to say so i couldnt understand cuz you over played his cards right they end up finding in a pipe he came a long way from the castles to a pipe would do it all over his face and hes a bad guy but you know they end up and i figured out why hes always fighting with iran and he wanted to rent to think that he had weapons of mass destruction so they would be scared and they wouldnt go all the way etcetera etcetera nixons so he couldnt thats why overplayed his hand he couldnt not say that and then we ended up making a big mistake and weve totally destroyed the middle east and and then come barack obama and hillary and what happened there is now were in and he announces another time just like he did with a so he announces when were leaving only got creamed all over the place just cringe i mean they beat him all the time you know we dont win wars and we dont win anything win wars member i remember when i was young we never lost a war right now we lose every time we cant be nice we can beat anybody we cant make i will believe me they and itll be fast it wont be long itll be fast cuz i want to get around to rebuilding our country believed i will so so you look at what happens with a he announces that this is the same thing is with the fifty men fifty men will be going in the same thing we will be leaving iraq on october st at in the afternoon so what happens is the enemy since a while theyre leaving the living is great lets pull back the hell do we have to get your dinner you read about all the stories that they want to get guilty they dont want to go and their families they dont want their families killed folks remember that they dont want their families but they dont get killed so they pull back obama leads now weve spent in iraq two trillion dollars thousands of lives wounded warriors all over the place where i love and were gonna take care of so obama made a mistake shes totally predictable hes totally predictable were going to send the were going to take him out here now if you would have said weve never taken them out were going to build up with even if you do it and i know the presses usa will mr trump would tell afib he would tell if i dont tell us why would they ever say that were taking the people out when they took him so now the enemy would say if it were me i would say were not going anywhere as youre going to suffer for the rest of your life and your children you graduate everybody and theyre going to say this case frickin crazy we give up we can we give her so obama told them when were leaving left and then they go and its a mess now and as yours you stay there you know you know the fact that when you see the same papers and teamsters announcing but iran is taking over iraq isis is taking much of the oil which finally were bombing ok should have kept it but finally we really did have his mind was to keep my with the bombing and keep it ok now a bombing it and somebody else is gonna get it right so so so pathetic and you know what i wanted to do with the proceeds of that oil i wanted to give a lot of it to the families that suffered and lost lives are lost their sons and daughters in iraq i wanted to give a lot of it and by the way if you gave each family a million or two million dollars thats peanuts you have so much money left over give them more than that but you could give them a lot of money because they suffered and what do we have for it what do we have for it so i was gonna give and and this was another thing people said oh you cant do that for you can do anything you can do whatever you want to do you can do anything you could do anything and i wanted to give that money a lot of it to the families that lost sons and daughters and and to the wounded warriors who dont have arms and legs and and their bravery that all of us put together so anyway so just to finish off the pole so they said best in the military and foreign policy i was a great honor for me because a lot of people think that ill be the best in jobs by far i will be the greatest that god ever created believe me ill be good and they have been messin economy not liked by point by like points like like i on one of my think i was at and number two was it nine thats a big difference and they have be by far by far best in leadership so i said lets best on military and foreign policy if im best certain leadership if im best on the economy what are we having an election for lets go you know a couple of things about the campaign the one thing they did sam not as nice a person to some of the other people and i told the woman and i actually am a nice person but i told the woman who said that she said to me mr trump im voting for you i love you but i you nice enough to be president i said let me tell you something man im glad you voted for me but i am a nice person believe it or not im gonna have a lot of good relationship but but i will tell you specially with the people you know we have a good relations but i will tell you this i really believe it doesnt matter because i think this is going to be an election based on competence we need somebody really and im really cops and we need people like carl icahn industrial a great businessman hes worth a fortune is a great negotiator one of the great negotiators other people are into a semi big the biggest businessman someone heard us we dont even like to be but they know im really smart i do incredible company remember when i filed the papers are on his maybe as companies not as big what turned out to be much bigger much better much like they cant believe it you never heard anything about it since i file they went down there hundreds of am looking over the papers oh my god hes really much bigger than we ever thought he built an unbelievable company they went down there they say more people would down looking at those papers almost a hundred pages of financials and incredible company very low debt tremendous cash flow the press was devastated right fellas were you devastated they were down there would and i tell you that not to brag about my company cuz its a private company nobody knows what i have private companies beautiful that was really a big opening for me i mean run for president its tough and hes using all my life ive heard of your very successful person you cant run for president i understand what it is because they make you a lie and they cheap and theyre dishonest you know many of them many of them i had a story recently where i went up in the polls are leading by a lot and the story was when will trump leave the race like one of the commentators in the morning good guy joe scarborough he always jokes well trumped up in the polls that means i guess hes leaving arrests leaving let me tell you im not leaving folks ever im not ever im not leave a woman to win were gonna win i think were gonna win but you know these pundits who are worthless you know george will because i mean these guys they said he would never run lot of pretty hes got the personality of that piece of concrete he goes he would not run he would then i announced theyre running you will not file his paper he will file format a format is the first filing will you sign your life away then i file for me he goes oh well you will not find his finances and if he does they will never be filed on time because hes probably not as richest people so i was one of the only ones have filed ahead of schedule in fact i have to be honest my financials are so good that i hadnt really decided on running as it does take cuts i have to be honest not the kind of got to those people had to i just brought up here not the kind of cuts the wounded warriors have in the vets have a day what i dont have that cuts those are real guts but it takes guts to run it but then he said he wont so they turned out to be the only reason i talked about how good my companies is because thats the kind of mentality we need running the country and i was actually you know they will say hell never filed as financials because who knows when they had no idea i was going to file them even if i didnt run i was serious about not running to you know i did you know the famous scene of my coming down the escalator with my wife melania look very beautiful coming down the escalator we have to you i have one beautiful first lady that i could and shes got a great heart and she is really smart but shes got a great heart but shes coming down and shes a very calm person and shes waving beautifully like this famous scene played all the time coming down the escalator i think they play it because shes in the picture because im leaving and shes just going like this but if you remember that famous just a wonderful do this i mean im standing up the presses all over the place the place was surrounded they will tell you ive never seen him like the academy awards and i did this i said i could get deep breath i came down the escalator and here we are who would have known this was going to happen when i know this is you know and a lot of things have happened and a lot of great things that happens its because you know i had no idea that i do as well as weve done this for now the big thing these same characters that you know that said i was gonna run now theyre saying well its only a question of time before he could see why i was interviewed by chuck todd of meet the press hes a nice guy and he asked me that question i was just came out where i was leading substantially and he said will you get out of the race and i said to myself that question ever been asked to a person that just took the lead you know its such a negative question is this and i made a mistake i said in giving his couple of months ago weve recovered from that mistake but i made a mistake i said im leading now i have the biggest crowds the biggest everything if for some reason i went down in the polls i believe in polls i think you know theres at least their reflection of what if for some reason i went down in the polls and people didnt want to see me anymore so you have a hundred people show up when you have a thousand or and like today or you wouldnt do well i mean im not a message probably go out and it was a killer answer you know why next day truck may leave the race now right i dont believe and i remember rand paul whos at like they asked him the question are you leave the race is gonna leave the race and i have to leave but they as and im not knocking but its political speak versus somebody that was never a politician before im giving all the reasons for which italy but im doing better than a dividend and the question shouldnt have been asked but i give all the reasons and actually my wifes it was a really nice answer was such an honest answer i said good i think i killed ok so what happened vs rand paul hes at one or two hes leaving otherwise hes not gonna be senator from kentucky so they would you consider leaving absolutely not i will not leave the race there was no story they asked a couple of other guys there at zero you leave the race you know its going to zero and have no money other than that doing very well right now there are i saw it the other day they asked lindsey graham to in south carolina im at hes the sitting senator not think of it they said senator gramm are you going to leave the race absolutely not i will not leave their eyes politician im not blaming graham im not blaming rand paul but theres no story i gave an honest answer and i end up i will not ever leave this race and you know what and im still number one by a lot so thats the reason im not leaving just a couple of things im gonna talk to you about a few things and i know its a crazy day and with the tragedy yesterday that was some horrible thing people see that and they just its its terrible to watch but i love this group of people i love this area i know this area have friends here these are amazing these are the people you built the country folks who built the country youve done an amazing but just so you know because theres been a lot of talk lately about stances on different things without me there wouldnt be any talk of walls there wouldnt be any talk of immigration illegal immigration those folks would not have a voice at all theyve been treated horribly theyve been treated so badly probably worse than anybody i mean you see that and because of me and im very proud of it immigration is one of the top couple of subjects may be the top and a lot of peoples minds its a tough subject and when you get to texas its gotta be a real subject as you know the ones that are really i mean i had such a crowd in phoenix arizona they get the brunt of it you get the brunt of it some people dont know it as much but when you got in new hampshire you know they have a tremendous heroin problem in doing tremendous beyond anything that you can believe that it comes over the border so theyre all affect everybody is affected when you look at the gangs in los angeles a lot of those gangs are illegal immigrant visa tough duty by the way they will be out of this so fast they will be out of there so fast theyll be out before i start to offset now all fast by the way they will be out of there so fast we have some of these tough gangs and theyre all illegal immigrants and those guys got and were not going to put him in our jails i know a lot of people to put him back with bringing back to the country that came for let them use their jails ok let them use their our jails are brimming right now with people that shouldnt be in our prison system theyll be in there for years and years and years and will be paying for im not gonna happen folks were bringing them back where they came and went and when a specific country sent them over to the united states because we have among the dumbest people in the world trading us and we accept their people ok when they send them theyre not coming through not with me then i come in general eisenhower you been reading about the shoe nobody even knew about brought it up is better than that guy i do that but i probably couldnt get voted i dont know but it looks good but in general eisenhower i like ike everybody liked ike even though is a general everybody liked him but you know why because general macarthur was a very special guy stuff a genius the highest marks in the history of west point general douglas macarthur good right and general macarthur couldnt stand taking orders from anybody cuz he felt he was superior to everybody and ike was a less than average student at west point and because they couldnt understand you know to this day general douglas macarthur had the highest marks in the history of westport pretty good you know im into the academic thing to be honest something right and he couldnt stand but we have macarthurs and we have we have general george patton by the way what do you think general patton would do as hes listening barack obama say we are sending tomorrow morning at nine oclock fifty people he would be shes right now spinning in his grave and so is but eisenhower was a nice man i like that was a slogan like mine is make america great again make america great again how good is that is that could do i hit that hit it on the head you know ive had guys trying to copy some of the people running against me use that expression but i had legal rights to do you believe how good how good am i at this time so we put them on notice they werent allowed to make america great again the plane was landing before and the pilot saying coming and coming and ok youre cleared to land make america great again this is from the control tower by pilot said mr trump card that i wanted to kiss those people make america great again but i can i trust i like i could see was a lovable guy he was a nice guy but despite being a nice guy they had a problem with a little problem so they moved out one and a half million illegal immigrants moved about having a tremendous jobs you know jobs is a big thing theyre taking jobs from people that wanna we have a hundred million people a lot of work this percent unemployment is not to tell what is written and designed for politicians so they look good we probably have a we probably have percent unemployment ok if you look at the real numbers or i wouldnt be getting the crowds im getting or i wouldnt be getting the responses or the polling numbers we probably have so i like i said his task force and they moved a lot of people and they took him and they moved across the border and they came immediately back and then they moved him again and they came back they say this isnt working then they moved them all the way south and then never came back you know now trust up today at order to do things like that but they didnt even think about it they should know theyre here illegally she those days they are here illegally not legally and illegally everyone says to me lol riley the other night hes a great guy but he said to me had a little argument with me he said the court system will take you long time so if somebody walks over the line they bring them immediately back right now in our case we dont but you could they want government you bring it back ok so they bring back so they walk over the line a year ago you bring them back theres no difference if it was three years ago theyre here illegally here illegally and everybody said on the anchor baby i was wrong they said if you have a baby here and i discussed it and then i can not to be right just the same thing i could baby canada baby here if youre here illegally have a baby now you can have some court cases but believe me i would have a president i guarantee i went on the academic and i went on this bill because no i dont want to go through a court system every time you want to bring an illegal person i dont want to go i know more about courts of any human being on a ok and i dont want to go through a court system with the lawyers and the problem but the here illegally now let me tell you what happened with eisenhower as it gets mixed reviews now they sell was very harsh im sure wasnt some cases but let me tell you when they started and this was serious was it like playing games like today where everything so politically correct you know everyone knows you well we cant do that lets do this is serious stuff they moved by the way harry truman moved they say millions of people out millions harry truman before i move millions of people nobody talks about this they say what a bad guy am how it doesnt work it does work it does work and i wanted to come back by the way just so you know i want to make it clear i wanted to come back but i wanted to come back legally and if we need workers for the grapes and ill say this is a lot of people say the grapes grapes and i dont think any of you guys are going to be picking grapes ok i really dont think so wanna be picking the pockets of wall street but not grapes but if we need some people we can bring people in on work visas have to go out if you needed for the farms if you need them badly youre bringing to go to go out to be here legally they gotta be early so heres what happened in the case of ice and they move people they move people and they moved about you know what happened with the people that didnt get caught whatever you know what happened themselves they move themselves away to come to us next week jumped out of a month they almost back millions of people out there they left of their own volition not that stupid romneys stuff was self deportation i mean how theyre going to self deport oh yeah right then you wonder why he lost but this is something where many of them once the system started and once they saw there was no games they moved him out now today we have things like everify employer wassup sorry i cant do it i used everify and most of my jobs i have thousands and thousands of employees i have hired tens of thousands of employees many hispanic over these many many different as many from mexico today many many employees from the great but i have and i think to be its very important everify so now i find out all the legal now if they cant get a job to move on out there gonna move that nobody has soldiers began to move out so simple but a politicians a politician doesnt know what theyre all talk and no action all they know how to do is get reelected thats all theyre not and when you see all the problems are not going to have that kind of gonna have a lot of winning gonna be doing a lot of winning im telling were gonna win everything we start were gonna win cuz i went my whole life thats why it always bothers me that she had a great time and hes done really well but he doesnt really want to be president you know im doing this for my health ok i came to texas at twelve oclock in the afternoon because i wanted i want to do this i i want the end result somebody said well why you doing it and i said because i honestly believe that the american dream is dead but im gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before i really believe that i really but i really believe so if you look at rubio he was a member of the gang and that they and rubio want honesty give everybody hes just so you understand jesse anderson lightweights these are not people that can take us to the promised land then i like him very much as well as a member of the gang of a gang of eight you know that was that was a group that just wanted people to flow ok member of the gang of a sad when his poll numbers went down he all of a sudden became a nun member of the gang of eight so rubio is weak weak on illegal immigration week on the amnesty once everybody cant do it carson very very weak on immigration very very very weak whatever he wants worse he wants a path to citizenship for people that came into the country they give it they come in illegally now theyve become one of the problems with that is we have right now we have right now millions of people wanting to come into the country and theyve done it through legal channels theyve done it right through legal channels and weve gotta be fair to those people also so just in a nutshell on immigration because i know how important it is for texts were gonna have a wall gonna be a great product that people can walk over to climb of this is gonna be a serious wall and its going to be built at the right course mexico is going to pay for the wall believe they gonna pay for their going to pay for it to get the bad ones out really fast i mean so fast and the rest gonna have to happen and everyones gonna be happy in the end people are going to be happy to have jobs were gonna do a great job would be fair to do it with a very very big heart its going to be done humanely remember that its going to be done digest to finish off and wanna just cuz i wanted to really hard on that a little bit the immigration because its so important in such a big factor and has become such a big factor in the race im proud of it but we are going to negotiate great deals i mentioned carl icahn before im going to use the smartest we have the smartest people have the best people we have the best minds with the best business minds we dont use a wheeze political hacks we used people that put money into a super pac and they end up getting jobs because they gave a couple of bucks to a super pac and the super pacs by the way i dont have super pacs i turn i said i dont wanna super pacs are controlling your senators theyre controlling every candidate will only do whats right for those people that gave them money the donors the specialinterest those are the only people believe me they control the politicians nobodys give me any money other than the small donors where frankly if people send in min i have to take the money because its not that its a lot of money if you send that money back its so in so how do you send it back we dont want your money so i take small donation small and i say thats fine because thats like an investment in the country but its peanuts but i dont think anybody putting my own money funding my own campaign im spending a fortune and and i am spending but so far i have spent that much so far listen to this one is just at that some people i can some people say maybe it doesnt sound good but i like the business people like it so far ive spent less money than anybody else and ive had the best result of anybody else right and that beautiful that pm large body of the best result and thats what i like and thats what it be nice if we could do that with a country we spent less money in education we spend more money than any other country by double and triple and yet rated number in the world we have nations that you wouldnt believe ahead of us we have nations that you wouldnt believe so were going to win on trade were going to take our jobs back were gonna bring jobs into the country were gonna be china were gonna beat japan was gonna do great with mexico we gonna do wonderfully with that horrible i ran back i love to renegotiate deals ok but we gotta take that horrible deal the worst deal ive ever seen negotiated with an end obamacare will determine were going to terminal what time and were going to replace it with something thats far better far less expensive for you and for the country were going to replace it with something thats really good and the insurance companies will not like me because right now they are making a fortune and your rates are you are getting your premiums doubling and tripling their doubling and tripling day going up percent nobody knows whats happening the insurance companies they backed obama theyre making a fortune i couldnt care less about the insurance company to jail so were going to start winning again were gonna wind so much i sometimes joke i say you didnt win so much youre gonna get sick of winning but the chances we never get sick of winning we never get sick of winning were gonna wind so not gonna be so proud of this country you get to be so proud of your president and i love you all make america great again thank you thank you thank youwe love you we love you amazing you know one of the reporters just ask me why dont you do town hall meetings i said because we have now the equivalent of you know theres another room this size where its fact also so we have five thousand people had added we do town halls will be doing about today and we still will be able to catch up but i want to thank everybody special people special place weve had such an incredible journey since you remember june sixteenth since june sixteenth the famous escalator ride and we just got back from iowa and i want to tell you theyre great people in iowa and i love them she says you know ill tell you we really did you know i started off and it was very interesting very interesting little think its a coffee system which is a much more difficult system i dont say better and its a weird but certainly more difficult and we started off and when i announced on june there was seventeen people i had registered i hadnt been put in polls so i didnt know what was going to happen and in iowa they said dont go to iowa you dont play in iowa me and i said why i know people and i was a great people they should know its not gonna work and you go theres not gonna work so i said i have to do it i want to go there and i went there and i think we didnt really well we did really well and they said if you get in the top youd be lucky and actually came out the first time was like number and then it went to eight and went to five and we finished number two and frankly had i known we could have finished number two maybe i would have spent more time there i would have taken a day or two off from here but that wouldnt have been good but you know its a lot of interesting is a very proud of this i skipped the debate because i wasnt treated properly door nor was i was properly and you know when our country is did read it properly we have to behave that way also just so you understand when you not treated like his supposed to be treated you have to remember so what happened what happened is i did and then i said you cant do that and they had it we could have broken the world record we would have broken debate that we did the first one that million people really i think it was even more than that after final cap and i think this thing would have had probably million people but you couldnt do it and ill tell you i am so happy i didnt do it because in one hour we raised six million dollars for the vets six men we raised sixty million for them and if you told me i could have finished first if i did the debate or second plus six million for the vets ill take the six million for the vets day so we got the biggest vote i just looking at statistics here we got the biggest vote ever in the history of a primary and iowa by like sixty thousand people came out extra im not gonna say that was made but believe me it was me you know two nights ago i three nights ago one of the candidates that are running against highlyrespected was here and they had two hundred and fifty people so we have five thousand that should be a good sign thats like our poll thats like an automatic poll so that i got the vote that i got was other than the one vote because we had so many people was the biggest vote in the history of iowa republican caucus have been the biggest in the history of iowa for a republican cause you know when you think amazing thing is the press that all of them somewhere great somewhere saying came in second day started off in that he came in second but with me that only his second id like to his second that much either to be totally but one poll came out that said i was leading by points and i guess you know coming second in the headlines were trumped comes in second hes humiliated seventeen people will be cited now you have eleven i come in second humiliated you know you have you have to think of it people ever ever so marcos a nice guy marco rubio nice guy and he comes in third right and all of a sudden he comes in third hes a senator does this stuff for a living is a professional politician he comes in third i come in second drop no good rubio unbelievable night unbelievable unbelievable thank you gotta think of this and then they said hes very very close hes very close so hes good maybe i think its about a difference of almost votes thats a lot thats a lot of votes but you know for iowa that a lot of us live like and some large amount of but he came in second the headline is winner of the night marco rubio drop humiliated didnt do that well and im saying that comes in third and hes a professional politician at ibm by you know a lot how come the guy that comes in third business typical reporter the media the worst people ever the person that comes in third on many of the networks is being covered like its one of the great victories in the history of politics in this country and the person thats not a professional politician on the job creator i build great companies that build great buildings i do a lot of great things ive employed can i i dont do this crap i deployed tens of thousands of people over the years im so proud of the company has built an unbelievable company in fact they went to check it when i did the filing with the fec federal elections they were see all those cameras back their trip alone they were down though they were gonna find first they said ill never run right then that he said hell never file format a format is where you signed your life away you give them everything the family the doghouse you give up the world they should have never file format then they sell for me announced that it believed it then they should one who never file as financials and if he did he lists for the extensions because you can get an extension that goes through ever i dont want an extension i told one of the big accounting firms one of the best firms in the world one of the biggest most respected i said listen to get these done i felt almost a hundred pages bigger than anything ever filed with federal election by far you know these politicians they put one page in the need five extensions ok you know why theyre afraid somebody knows about the cash theyve been taken to want to be careful ok they want to be careful i want to be politicians all talk no action so what happens i love you too darling so what happens is i go in ifile and come back and i dont believe the companys much bigger much better some of the greatest assets in the world buildings in manhattan bank of america building big chunk and san francisco some of the greatest at sister marion scotland where they play the british open so many different great assets doral in miami beach hundreds of acres in miami beach you know darrell so many and theyre looking at this low debt very little debt almost no debt so this low debt tremendous cash flow and some of the greatest assets in the world and the number is through the roof and im not saying that to be braggadocio some saying because thats the kind of thinking we need in this country our country is going to hell going to have so the president goes down and they see it and it was such a dud they were devastated they thought this trip is it you know they all said i wouldnt file and i wouldnt run because maybe im not as rich as people think thats what the hell was that and wonder if this can only happen at a truck rally what you know that could be a way we get him to turn the cameras right i let the cameras dont have and what the press will never ever ever report is the crowds they dont do it they reported for birdie they said the other day recently i had people he had three thousand people they said birdies centers had an amazing crowd of people i had when its my turn to go on trial speech today front of a crowd it is so dishonest and i have friends at the reporters and they tell me they cant report the truth they cannot report that they told what to do and if you happen to be a nice our side of the equation for the most part just very dishonest just very dishonest so what i do like is when that man holds up that john oh by the way i should reprimand him because you know member when i took a lot of heat remember that somebody said something that wasnt that nice to our president and they said donald trump did not defend the president would have hit defend me think it depends so they said donald trump did not defend the president had i said ok so they said i should have defended him and i should have done something so sir youre reprimanded ok so were not throwing him out folks right when i throw so i put in these statements and theyve been great and and i tell you because i probably would have filed them even if i didnt want you know it takes guts to run for president really does it takes guts it takes guts especially you know if youre a politician you run and you run and you lose and you win and you run so they do with us it takes courage but we needed one of us we have to do it we have to do it this so many things that are wrong so i wanted to just tell you and i feel so good and by the way while i have to have all those cameras gonna have to take care of a couple of things for the veterans carl icahn great businessman hell put him in charge of negotiating with china will stop their five hundred billion dollar trade deficit i can tell you right now i can tell you right now but i have to say that good guy tough guy smart guy thats the kind of people we want is worth billions of dollars doesnt want anything hed love to represent we put him in charge of lets say china lets say japan lets say one or two countries probably one cause we have some great people we have the greatest negotiators in the world we have the smartest business people in the world we dont use them we used political hacks were used people that dont have a clue we used people that got the job because they give campaign contributions to these guys they get their job and they dont give a damn about the country they care about themselves and the subtle way its going to work okay carl icahn great business man cave to the vets now this was when i was supposed to be up debating big deal this was what i was supposed to be up to bed we have steve roth friend gave fifty thousand we have the fisher family gave bridget left donald trump donald trump gave one million dollars we have a rich guy from new york city a friend of mine i cant believe it this guy was the worst braggart ive ever seen if he gave money he wanted his name up in lights and all of a suddenly became like please please dont tell my name please im saying why does loaded by the way why he said because theyve changed see people can change people can change i said you really dont want to know about like so i said look if you know what my name it i wont so i just called rich guy from new york city one million dollars for the events of one of the great business been in this country mr phil ruffin and his incredible wife gave from las vegas and lots of other places got plenty of places he gave one million dollars to the vet says that great i wrote a letter from marvel you know they do the great movies i think hes got like five of the greatest grossing movies of all time hes a great geniuses wife is incredible lowering to the vets ok not great down and there are many more there are many more so i just want to tell you that that was such an amazing it was just such an amazing thing and i call these people say could you give a half a million one of them said to me i should could you give these are really successful people i say could you give a halfmillion he goes no i wont give a million i said ok ill take a right on behalf of the vets outside so we have a lot of good things happening so the whole experience and i was great the only prob is depressed didnt treat me right instead of saying you did really well you didnt do too much over the ibm focus here that have been focused here and south carolina by the way very much but they said instead of saying unbelievable job they said it was disappointing thirdplace was fantastic but it was a little too so was one of those so i i had a good time i learned a lot of made a lot of good friends at night when theyre really they are great people one other thing i have to say because were all lot of us are business people we want to make our country great again such a great thing is that is that the greatest of all themes thats what it is somebody said what are you going to do for the country and i said to myself you not have a lot of time here theres a radio person and we by the way do it howie carr his erroneous someplace where is how a where is howie howie where the hell are you is he a great guy we love how a car right we love how he can win love tom brady we love tom brady right now we love coach bella jack dont worry im telling you is the greatest guy ever lose but tom is a great friend of mine hes a great guy said the nicest things about me you know in massachusetts my poll numbers went up like points they went up to or onehour sup because tom brady said trump is great thats good you know you dont often get too many people that say something nice well as a positive impact but tom is in that category so where is howie carr the legendary house because hes here hes got that radio going he has been so nice to me thank you how a guys so heres the final on that whole thing in terms of money spent to provoke right right in stats stats money spent for a vote i was almost the last and i was just something nice about that you know theres something nice about that you know as an example of the campaign not gonna spend a lot of money its all my own self funding can you believe this and ill tell you something folks let me just tell you cuz i said it before i told it to the president make it a big story probably they would make everything and then they change it but thats ok i told the precious we had a press conference i said ill be honest with you i dont think that i have gotten the proper credit for the fact that im so funny i dont really i have turned down if i wanted you know bush has a hundred and twenty eight million dollars ago i mean we have been better off just taken the money throwing it out a window or something but if you look at if you look at ted cruz hes got tremendous money from the oil companies gonna take care of the oil companies to take care of wall street even though it did reporters hes gonna take care of if you look at some of these people although they all have money so and restore from wall street is from oil its from different things now those people are a hundred percent going to like a little puppet gonna take care of those interest with me i have no but i just want to do the right thing why i said something at the press conference that i dont think they knew what the hell i was talking about some respond but some of these guys are dumb as a rock and i you know you know when this man lifted up the sign i like that for one reason because they had to move the cameras around the show the crowd ok thats the only way they see the crowds as well we have if we have protesters died fact sometimes i actually think about doing it im gonna set my protesters up in corners of rooms because those cameras never moved from my face because they dont want to show how many people i have they dont wanna showed some movement we have a movement going folks we have hope i have to be honest and i want to thank him before i just before its too late but scott brown for him to come up and call and say i love what you doing i love will you going he loves this area and he loves you people for him to endorse me is a very important thing so wherever the house got it right its a very very important and ive had other great import just great ones do you know jerry falwell junior fantastic liberty university the job is done sarah palin gave us a tremendous endorsement romantic and you know gave me great endorsement that you people are really going to like his everybody likes this sheriff joe from arizona sheriff joe you know when sheriff joe gives you an endorsement you know youre the king of the border right you know all these other guys that im competing against their own and women theyre all coming up there are coming up in this thing when i originally announced i talked about illegal immigration if i didnt bring it up and did i take key if i didnt bring it up it wouldnt even be a subject right now and then all of a sudden and i was gone i said this campy like this you cant go on like this for months and months no human being can take this amount of incoming no human being and they were just going after me and they said its terrible and then after about two three weeks people such as opposed now theyre coming then all of a sudden four weeks five weeks go by then you see the kind of tremendous crime thats been committed by the people that come into our country illegally tremendous crime then you have the killing of kate beautiful kate and centrist iska then you had the killing of jameel the woman you have the killing of the woman a year old veteran who was raped sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant and thats three people thats you have to see whats going on you have to see whats going how bad it is not only that the economy and i want people to come into the country but i want them to come in they have to come in legally right legally they have to come in legal so we have all of these endorsements their incredible endorsements but i do have to say one of the gentlemen that compete against my wife is watching television the other day and shes listening to this guy boring falling asleep keep falling asleep its like a sleeper and he said i wont use the name because i dont want to embarrass anybody he said he said and we will build a wall she said darling premier listen you just said you know who the hell ever heard of building a wall except for me so now that they dont give us credit when i said in iraq when i said take the oil right foot four years ive been saying take the oil then after those horrible paris attacks all of a sudden they said we will take the oil the problem is that for years late and what i said take the oil i meant take it they mean blow it up i mean take it take it and give some of the profits to our wounded warriors give some of the profits to the vet and the families that have lost people in iraq have been saying that ive been saying that for years take the oil and you know it and they just did it but theyre not doing it right you know they dont want to bomb the oil because it would be environmentally it would be a pollution event it would be an event of pollution as they say it will add to the carbon footprint do you believe is the way we fight our was scott you think general douglas macarthur used to have the carbon footprint in mind when he bombed the hell out of right general patton did he think the carbon footprint general pack you have a mention the carbon footprint smack in the face and say what do you know i i mean i actually heard this im not sure i believe it but i think i believe it they said one of the reasons were not bombing the oil is because they dont want that pollution going up into the atmosphere i made it the whole thing is ridiculous dont forget we have a president that thinks that global warming is many things this global warming that wasnt working so well theres right climate change this extreme weather the new on his extreme weather because you how can you miss with extreme weather even if its nice you say its extreme because it shouldnt be this site you know that global warming is really bad it was just not work then they went climate change and that was better but extreme weather is like perfect and we have a president that talks about the biggest enemy of the united states right the biggest number one enemy is is he calls it level is global warming climate change no one of those things he doesnt know eenie meenie miney mo whatever whatever the way now and let let me just tell you so climate change and the carbon footprint so he says for christmas or whatever he wants to go christmas by the late merry christmas dont you want to say merry merry christmas were gonna bring christmas back were gonna bring it back merry christmas happy holidays were gonna bring it back you see these departments you cant say merry christmas anymore dont shop there youll say merry christmas again very quickly but but for christmas but for christmas celebrates he gets into a boeing a very very old its cold air force one a very very old boeing with the old engines feeling knowing carbon and every other thing i dont think it happens during the year personally but thats ok so these old engines are spewing into the atmosphere i think about the carbon footprint but hes only going to hawaii so hes gone from washington to know why hes gonna play golf like so many times he plays golf that people on the pga tour you know that they admire him they say if they could play that much theyd be even better players so hes taken the boeing flying to hawaii you know how long that is all the engine seized of the big old engines spewing fumes hes over there for two or three weeks playing golf he then gets back hops in the plane flies back to watch it when he comes back and he talks about global warming up somehow i think that i russia radical islamic paris right from north korea i think that thats a bigger threat to global warming right now ok global warming we should be fairing folks is global warming caused by nuclear weapons and it will not smart thats whats gonna happen we better get really top really smart really vigilant have a problem we better stop playing games believe me we better stop playing games so we become the policemen to the entire world they pass peanuts we take care of japan lot of people dont even know his deals we make if we are attacked somebody at access would you rather have trumpets president of were attacked will beat the shit out of them anybody attacks you know i speak in a potential cause he hates obama so much food he said donald trump is a genius and hes the real leader over in that country and these people that im negotiating with all the time these people in the states with me they said you should disavow what putin of russia said i said im not disavowing that he called me a genius are you crazy dont worry i cant be seduced but wouldnt it be nice if you think about it would be nice if we actually got along with russia and others and we can use them to knock out ice is with us so that maybe we dont always have to pay for it knocked the hell out of but let them drop some of their bombs that cost a million dollars apiece let them use some of their weapons that caused billions and billions of dollars let them beat the shit out of isis also right right raised by the way i have to say thank you i love looking out out my number one that a bet is out taking good care of you if he doesnt take care of you i will say out youre fired a great guys become my friend and im taking care of them i told you before going to build a military so great so strong nobodys gonna mess with us nobodys going to mess with dont forget jeb bush and hillary clinton both the same day this if i dont like donald trump stone now that day three heads were chopped off in the middle east you worried about my tone but dont forget this is important im the one that didnt want to go and read iraq and beat the hell out of records are you going to destabilize the entire middle east and that was reuters in and before that reuters i said dont do it youre going to destabilize thats exactly what happened we have destroyed what happened is the middle east is totally destabilized array which made one of the great deals ever with a hundred and fifty billion dollars theyre gonna make nuclear weapons taken to self inspect how about that itself inspect listen we here is our president we hear youre making nuclear weapons would you please check the area and call me back tomorrow president obama i give you my word i give you my word we have just self inspected we are not going to ever ever make nuclear weapons in those areas and then the guys going right and then they have the other not only self inspection but then they have the other twenty four day period so we think that making nuclear weapons we have to inform them that clock starts ticking maybe in a month or two months or five months before the days kitchen right so this could go on forever in the meantime they clean up the shadow days wouldnt be enough to clean up anything days right and and and the floor battleship grey so when we walk in we sell nothing is happening here so to get days this is the dumbest agreement i think ive ever seen done by your man hes up from this area carey is he the worst negotiating i hear he wants to run for president if hillary gets put in prison thats what i hear you know what he cant run for president that deal is so bad why would i love to run just that one day i dont have to talk about how else hes messed up that hill is so bad what we love to run against kerry just with the deal all we have to do we paid a hundred and fifty billion dollars for billion now the most amazing thing you wouldnt have started anybody in this audience no not anybody but you would have walked in you would have said we want to preserve his back this is like four years ago this thing is the longestrunning deal ever see you would have said i wanna prisoners they would have said no no no you would have left you would have doubled up the sanctions they would have called you back almost immediately and they would it take you prisoners right we have a presence then you make sure the prisoners have landed the prisoners now have landed this is the art of the deal but the prisoners have landed now you go in a second time and you say fellows here i like to take the lumps of my father was used to sign you too tough fight a kindle upset as a ok pop nice so instead of saying were not giving you a hundred and fifty billion dollars that would do stuff you know to challenge ii you said this way a problem we own nineteen billion dollars our stupid people in washington just approved a budget three weeks ago how about that budget theyre getting everything you know obama is a horrible negotiator except when it comes to negotiating with the republicans hes a genius at negotiating with the republicans hes horrible with the ran with russia along with china japan but with the republicans he gets everything it wants we send these people there you know i dont mind the democrats because we know where theyre coming from but we said the republicans to get rid of obamacare they got to get rid of a hundred different things they got to cut the budget thinking about the budget they going to do all these things right they go there what happens what happens you know i tell the story they walk into the beautiful halls of congress they work and they see the capitol building and they look up in this is a beautiful ceiling and they see the columns ago so hi beautiful marble and they say a leash or jim callis lets use our search for the dallas weve arrived weve made it now if made it and then they say they go interest rates do you approve an extension of above right obamacare do you approve an extension of obamacare yes sir yes sir its disgusting its disgusting and by the way i have been opposed to obamacare from the day they conceived it and ted cruz comes out with an ad that im in favor of obamacare can you believe this just like he did with carson carson he said left iowa hes out of the rays vote for him did you hear about this one piece he said he left iowa cousins that nice guy been so bad is all of a sudden getting calls that he quit the race these guys said he quit the race is gun is out votes to him what kind of people we did it with additions and made up liar honestly and made up stories made up source everybody in here many of you know me from day ive been talking about going to repeal and replace obamacare from day one now were going to do if you remember so apart from day ive been saying repeal and replace obamacare ive been talking about the five billion dollar website that never worked for years right all of a sudden i see an ad or something donald trump is in favor of obamacare people calling you are against it thats too bad these are dishonest people these politicians these are worse than real estate people in new york im telling you now know these are truly desirous people that he said ben carson has quit the race the day of the election ben carson during a caucus then carson has quit the race and didnt get to race in other words ben carson quit and let me have your kind of crap is just and then he makes up the thing that says like its on a government document voter violation it says on top just like it comes right out of government municipal motor violation and it talks about it gives grades ef ef ef ef ef intruder but it says you can go vote but you gotta go vote for him and people are afraid that im in violation i have to go and what kind of people of these people and then the attorney general in iowa is investigated but by that time theyre all gone the elections over what kind of people do we have running for office now its honestly really really just honest and i think i know why you know why because he was born in canada was happened to be a problem that happens to you watch the democrats theyve already said they could assume he gets the nomination theyre gonna sue his ass off actually going to sue the country but theyre going to sue him and thats a pickmeup i wanted to mention one other thing because in iowa well were talking about so price of her head provote leading the pack ladies and gentlemen with the bush how did you know nobodys got or leading the pack demand that spent the most money per vote the legendary jet push with a number of this is per vote no but you know so far and per vote you know you couldve won the election just promised everybody a thousand bucks and you could have wanted you want to save money right you were the one you want to save a lot of money so jet my spent almost three thousand dollars a vote thats gotta be a record right is that in the guinness book would you check to get his book you have others with tremendous numbers of marco spent a lot almost of but at least you had a pretty good result he came in third no no he had a fantastic result unbelievable unbelievable came in third the guy that came in second of terrible terrible night dishonest people this is look at his numbers so hundreds and hundreds of dollars into jet pay close to or so who is one of the lowest up just about the lowest lowest the great donald trump louis by the way im very proud of the fact that i have spent less money than just about anybody else on the campaign and im going to start spending a lot for two reasons right number one i dont want to take any chances number two i feel guilty because when jeff is now spent two hundred and nineteen million are some ridiculous number and much of it is sort of earmark to me ends they cant be very good because every time he takes an at my numbers go up its a crazy deal but but i sped nationally im leading every poll in the state i mean honestly other than i which was the weakest when i had but in the state of leading the states leading here tremendously but every single national poll im waiting and just about i think every state poll of leading so i spent the least and i have the best reason right now have spared like jeb like a couple of others theyve spent the most and have the worst result can you put them in charge of this we have a school system we are getting rid of common core by the way and we are preserving education in the united states is the most expensive per pupil in the entire world right the most expensive in the entire world and there is no second place because its so much lower its ridiculous norway denmark sweden china visa like the top four or five places for education when number thirty i used to say right we just went up two notches when our number thirty in the world we spend the most reputable by far and we have the worst education by fog so were now number thirty and we spend the most wouldnt it be nice if they did like trump where i spend the least and i have the best results when the pickup now so thats what i mean our budget they said we are working on the budget and we think within years we can balance the budget twentyfive years twentyfive years these are serious people they said years the balance of a im talking about doing it relatively quickly and i mean were gonna have a better country were gonna better service were going to get rid of the waste fraud abuse all of the fall of the waste a disgusting waste and the fraud you look at the veterans administration take a look at whats happening in phoenix arizona its one of the great fraudulent scams youve ever seen the veterans administration within a take such great care of them it whats going on is unbelievable and were gonna make our country so strong and so solid i said the other day we gonna make a country rich again in a woman said mr trump that doesnt sound i said those were rich where debtor nation that horrible budget i told you about a little while ago thats worth two trillion dollars that takes care of our border letting everyone in that obama wants to come in that takes care of the syrian refugees who would never get a lot of folks i have a big heart but when never letting them and we dont know who they are we dont know where they come from its not going to happen its not gonna happen and anybody and everybody that comes in i want everybody to know we have to send them back we cannot take chances we cant afford it we cant afford to make mistakes like that you know we have the two people that were radicalized probably she radicalized him the married couple great who in california killed people with money very badly injured right we didnt know this we didnt know anything about it we had paris where they have the toughest gun laws in the world the toughest because within a preserve our nd amendment were not touching that second remember unless were gonna make it strong unless you will make it too strong so paris has the toughest gun laws in the world right that toughest in the world you cant have a gun unless youre a bad guy no problem so these disgusting thugs working to various places and start shooting people bomb bomb bomb move over a hundred and thirty people dead many people so gravely injured that they will be done theyre gonna be dying dying now and other people get a little light but theyre going to live a life in hell because theyre so horribly injured now if we had a few people in this room i can look at that guy right this mean we had a few of the people you you you let me pick a woman you and if somebody had a gun on their belt or somebody had a gun wrapped around their ankle and those bullets started coming out you know you see they were going to and you shoot a lot of them folks thats the only form its are its former protection you wouldnt have the carnage that you had there how about the military base five great young soldiers a gunfree zone one of the soldiers is a world class marks one of the best in the world theyre all top of the line soldiers theyre told to take their guns put on two hundred yards away seal a whack job walks in these five great beautiful soldiers smart tremendous future this wack job walks in and blow them away kills all five of them that was it because you know when these crazy people see gun free zone thats like saying candy to a baby right thats candy too baby so were gonna protect our second amendment to protect ourselves we are not touching our nd amendment and its under siege theyre playing now with bullets theyre playing now with magazines theyre playing with a lot we are going to protect our nd amendment remember that so when i started and when this all began on june sixteenth coming down the escalator it was all about border protection and speaking of border protection and called her she has been such a great help to me where is where is and where the hell are you stand up in court she is daniel she is so great right a dios amigo is that right bestseller right ok she is so great shes been so supportive of us she wants border security she wants people to come into the country legally she wants people to come and after coming through a process but theres nobody stronger and the subject is that right and i love the book i read the book go out and buy the book everybody hi great person shes a great shes a great person so when i started this whole deal come down and i talked about that i talked about obamacare repeal again i talked about the military i talked about the vets i talked about social security because were gonna save us social security and i talked about trade i talked about trade like nobody else to talk about it when carl icahn endorses me and many of the best business be men in the world and women they want to ask me i said dont bother nobody knows who that you are true you know not like the great scott brown nobody knows who they are but theyre the best business people in the world so when they endorse me and we use them good i talked about trade china is making a fortunate we cant do it in vietnam japan mexico both at the border and with trade you have to see whats the biz go moving the big plant from chicago into mexico for building one of the biggest auto plants in the world two and a half billion dollar at a plant in mexico what the hell are we doing what are we doing were bringing back jobs now we have a case corporate version where companies used to move like from here to florida or from here here to taxes or from texas to hear now we have a problem now we have companies that want to move to florida to texas they dont want to move to new hampshire point have you taken a beating by the way you talk about companies leaving you like a prime example what theyve done to you is incredible but were gonna bring up that were going to make it so they come back so now we have corporate inversion where companies like pfizer pfizer to rate companies are moving outside of the united states because taxes are too high by the way my bill and larry cudlow and so many others i think its great i put in tax policy big big cuts for the middle class the middle class in this country has been decimated big big cuts for business we are the highest tax nation in the world big big cuts right now and its gonna pass its going to go through and get things done thats what i do i get things done i do with politicians all my life will get it passed will get it passed so i used to talk about that and then when we had that horrible event in paris and we had a horrible event as you know in california and we had many other horrible of it i brought up the fact that we have to now start talking seriously about radical islamic terrorism we gotta talk about it and i said it i dont just like happened with the illegal immigration i said it was heat two weeks later was coming over and now theyre all trying to be tougher than me nobody could be done but there are trying to be tougher than me so now i talked about the whole situation there is such hatred of their people are flying airplanes into the world trade center what people are doing all of these acts not just here all over the world and i have friends in muslim they call me they say you have done a great service there is tremendous hatred you cannot solve a problem like that unless you start talking about we have a president that will not even discuss it or talk about it will use the words he wont say radical islamic terrorism its real its a problem and you cant solve the problem unless you going to be able to talk about so weve had tremendous i took a lot of heat and now everybody is saying thank you so much and its under discussion its a big big problem and you know what were gonna get itself one way the other was gonna get itself but we can no longer be this stupid country we can no longer be the country thats led by incompetent people we can no longer be the country that takes bergdahl a traitor traitor and take him and take him and swap him for five of the biggest killers that they have in the middle east that theyve covered it and wanted for a period of at least nine years so make of it weekend and they get these five killers that are already back in the battlefield trying to kill everything in front of them including us were not making deals like that anymore folks when i make it is like just to finish off you have to see the cover of time magazine last week amazing amazing cover amazing writer i never spoke to you know i do better when i dont

so much and we are going to make our country we are going to make this great great country even greater were going to make america great again i love you i love youunbelievable unbelievable and thank you very much mr record now understand why they have a record in this room what a room wat up place rada place iowa do we love it you know we had a big day today because a lot of polls came out and the polls were really nothing short of tremendous we had and it just came in new hampshire which is an amazing place with like you incredible people they love the country and they want to see our country be great again thats what they want they work hard they loved it and we had percent and the second place was so far back we wont even talk about it because i want to be nice tonight i wanna be nice in south carolina we had and that was a tremendous full tremendous energy tremendous money spent thirty percent second place again were gonna be so nice we be nice or not little bit so we had thirty percent thats the monmouth allbig gravis national poll just came out thats national won the election tomorrow coulters here and can we call for an immediate election please ok like in so many other countries i want an immediate election and alright go out by her book by the way its actually a very good book and so is it true now very importantly iowa anybody ever heard of the corn kernel everybody heard that corn kernel poll we were at won very easily and so we had four of them in that came from the state fair and ill tell you what last week i came to the state fair came well equipped in a helicopter and we took the kids for is and os kids love me those kids and i love those kids but we had an amazing time that my pilot said is that enough mr trump after going up and down like a yoyo i said nope you gotta keep doing it so we had we had an amazing time but you know having gotten that voters i know it means a lot to the people here and having gotten that vote is incredible so heres whats happening a little bit of a different situation i think maybe then has happened before a great journalist called me somebody that i dont know but somebody that have great respect for one of the major newspapers and he said could i ask you one question how does it feel i should has what shell he said this was the summer of trump do you believe this how good is that for my ego is that what they said he said i mean and hes really one of the day the presses whos who is and who is it but one of the really top people not even necessarily a fan of mine but i think hes becoming a fan rapidly he said how does it feel so i said why do you ask that question because it doesnt feel that mean i get a win you know its one thing to have the summer of trump doesnt mean anything unless we win the nomination and we gotta beat hillary or whoevers running whoever is running this otherwise it doesnt it doesnt mean i dont know if you lose like what does it all matter and he said it doesnt matter if you win or not what youve done has never been done you know nobodys seen whats happened here nobodys really seen this with the polls and the enthusiasm in the press and the ratings and you know why those cameras are all red lighted because of ratings if i didnt get ratings wouldnt be here they wouldnt be here then not nice people they dont care about me they dont care about you they dont care about anything the only thing they care about his ratings you know what i did the apprentice which was a tremendous success i was hosting saturday night live and lorne michaels came up to me and it was bedlam it was bedlam the show is number one it was doing like crazy and here i am hosting saturday night live my mother and father would never believe this and learn my clothes comes up to me said this is great he said you know we learn it wont always be like this someday the ratings wont be good and nbc will call me and theyll say im sorry mr trump but the ratings are no good were gonna cancel the show and he looked at me and he said ill never forget it he said no theres one thing wrong they wont even bother to call true they wont even bother to call and you know the apprentice was a tremendous hit nbc renewed his i may be like the only one or one of certainly like you can count on one hand that turned down a major reno effect mark burnett said you got to be kidding you gotta be kidding you turning down a major renewal equaled a renewal he said you turning down a renewal nobody turns it down and i turned out our new from many many shows and see the kind of money they paid me remember you had that certain anchor that said he doesnt believe it by then he had to apologize a lot of money that you earn a lot of money because i told the heads of nbc the head of comcast is an amazing guy great guy just call him steve but i want to tell you hes a great guy to head of nbc the head of reality television they came to my office like five months ago they sat in my chair she said donald we want we want you we love you dont love me so much any more apt to be on and i said to him sellers i really want to run for president i wanna make america great again through simple i want to do it and and they didnt believe me they didnt believe me and i said im gonna do it and they had the upfront fee upfront is when they announce all the show and they said were announcing renewing the apprentice with donald trump i still cant believe it i told them nobody believed me and my wife actually said to me she said you know nobody believes youre running as i looked at it serious mostly less time but i looked at it but very own seriously over this but last time i looked at it pretty seriously and i said what do you mean if you ever actually announced you gonna go through those people like me to actually im a nice person nobody knows that drew people dont i tell people im a nice person it in some ways its not good cause now were gonna talk about china and negotiation and i want to be in this person for that but i love people i love helping people and my wife said to me millennia she said if you run but you have to announce because if they take polls nobodys gonna say youre running right and and knows that and i said well i dont know and ill tell you what it takes courage to run it really does your really exposing yourself like greece honestly a lot of the presses especially the political pressure to the financial press has been pretty good to me over the years in business week magazine they named me a while ago the best into peoples fall the best negotiator wouldnt it be nice to have a good negotiator wanna brag about it just let it be nice i mean look at whats happening with china ive been predicting china ive been saying chinas taking our jobs our money are based on manufacturing i just told the press and we owe them think of it theyve taken on money on our jobs and manufacturing of it if taken everything is one of the greatest chefs in the history of the world what theyve taken out of our country theyve rebuilt china and we owe them think of it we owe them they take everything one point four trillion dollars how do you do that thats like a magic how good are they use negotiated they take everything we owe them money we owe japan one point four trillion same number we are both trip for whatever reason same number the balance the deficits the numbers are crazy if you look at the deficit we have with japan the deficit we have with china to deficit we have with almost everybody honestly their abusers their big abuses and by the way i love them they buy my apartments its true i on a big chunk the biggest chunk i own as you may be no the bank of america merrill lot of people didnt know actually most people didnt i on the bank of america building in san francisco big big big chunk and its a great building from the chinese green they still dont know what happened but thats what we need right eye on twelveninety big big jump avenue of the americas many building in europe but i do great with the chinese and theyre great people the problem is the leaders are too smart for a leaders so its very simple im a freetrader i believe in free trade right i like three i like free trade but three trades only good if you have smart representatives its not good if we have dummies its not good of our leaders are incompetent its not good when theyve never read the art of the deal one of the great books of all time second to the bible but thats way way way deep second you know how far below it is somebody held up the book the other day said thats my favorite book of all time i said no no dont let me change my second favorite book this is whats your favorite at the bible its not even close people were shocked they were actually said that but it is the greatest book of all time the bible nothing even close so we have a situation where people that run for political office and i had to stay years they do really like chance and it is something thats not very pleasant and you read things about yourself that dont exist very little good a lot of bad things that arent true and i have to tell you with that ive met some unbelievable really talented political reporters but ive also met some very bad ones in very dishonest and we have to do something about our country we have to take it back you know ive been using a term that hasnt been used in a long time called the silent majority in the senate majority im this island and theyre tired of politicians are there any politicians in the room is where excluding your fabulous ok but politicians are all talk and no action a trip that tired you know ive been watching bush on the border hes in a seersucker suit is talking about yes no yes the anchor baby i shouldnt say thank you baby you know he puts out a report saying do not use the term anchor baby then i used it might pose go through the roof and now hes using a good baby and hes taking criticism and you know the funniest thing is that hes taken tremendous criticism for using the term anchor baby and i use it all the time and nobody cares rice acres this would be expected from you know right crazy place but politicians are all talk and no i saw that little bit of the debate and i love doing the debate i was treated very unfairly at that debate to be honest with you because i want every poll time magazine we won the polls i so happy but but i was treated and then i watch the politicians and the politicians talk now i have heard that jeb bush was the mentor to marco rubio nice dude nice people i think jeff is a nice person hes very low energy im not used to that kind of a person negotiating with japan negotiating with china when these people walk in the room they dont say hello hows the weather so beautiful outside isnt it lovely how the yankees doing doing wonderful great they say we want deal he jumped out of the sea but i watched by the way before i say this who would you rather have negotiating against china against iran what a deal that is ok you talk about incompetent people against anybody jeb bush hillary clinton or drum i think so you believe me graded on a speech that i made recently they gave me always they gave me these great great day said the one mistake he makes is that he speaks through the applause its true you know what caused them have time they gave me his trademark they said his speaking to let the way i move my hands i never thought of it they said they love this that but but they said but he speaks rulers employers and its bad for him because he kills a lot of applause and i thought about it i said you know that i tried not doing that but i dont like i want to get going you know i want to get things done everybody here know that but i dont care i dont care if hes nice because i want somebody thats gonna make great deals and make us rich again and he cant do it marco rubio was not supposed to run right because he wouldnt run because his mentor in florida the state of florida which by the way i beat both of them in the post can you believe it is sitting senator governor and rub his way the hell up here its crazy but but marco rubio was all of a sudden he announced hes running and people thought it was very disrespectful to a person that brought him along slowly brought him along right so beautiful so what happened and it was interesting i said oh now those me if i want bush and i brought somebody along and i am older than marco and all of a sudden to guide the young guys that i brought along said im running against you and its not my turn but i dont care cause im really anxious im really driven by myself and im running against american i would really go after that id say hes the most is little guy hes a terrible person is horrible and i hate him ok said to myself not to the rest of the world but i believe me i wouldnt be so i saw them on a stage recently and chips hello marco said dear friend of mine hes a dear dear friend hes such a wonderful person and marcus i love jeb you notice yet never uses his last name why because hes ashamed of it why but if i were barca but in particular if i was jap i wouldnt say marcos a good friend of mine marco did something that he wasnt supposed to do he never said this before and i watch these two guys and hugging and kissing and holding each other very much like actually chris christie did with the president hugging and kissing and theyre still proclaiming that great deep love for each other and im saying politicians oil its all bull we gotta stop we need people that are gonna take us to the promised land we need people that are going to be great so again we look at becks thank you you look at mexico which is the new china by the way theyre doing great and whats come out you know a lot of incoming as rush limbaugh said he said trump has taken more incoming when i first announced did was tell the truth but you look at mexico the new china you look at fort building a massive planted you look at other companies from europe from all over a plant was going to be built in tennessee big big billion dollar outta my plan will plant a sapling built in tennessee and im gonna go to mexico nabisco holdings in chicago have a great building nabisco have a factory sector that make orioles im never eating oreos again ever ever maybe maybe if i could find some made in the united states but then closing their big plant in chicago and theyre moving it to mexico whats going to be so where and why are we doing this why are we allowing it to happen so what i would do if i were president i talk to these people somebody has to talk to and if you dont talk to me its never gonna change never gonna happen and you can get them to stay in chicago you can get them to build someplace else in the country you can get for it believe me to stay in this country now sometimes its so unfair the trade agreements if you look at the amount of business thats been moved out about whether to mexico or many other countries been moved out its absolutely uncontrollable by the people that we have courage and we can do stooping to change now let me just tell you i tell this all the time i go to us i dont want you i dont want to you know i have carl icahn ready killer killer i have other people already have people that is so nasty so mean so horrible nobody in iowa will want to have dinner with them too horrible human beings i admit their wall street killers couple of nice like about two percent but theyre the greatest negotiators in the best i know the best i know guys are over rated i dont guys that are really good i dont people that youve never heard of that a better than all of them will get his job back but i would say lets say the head of ford and youve heard me say this to me thats a big abuse two and a half billion per plant get a big that plan how many plants do we close to build a new plant in mexico two and a half billion dollars yeah right so how many pounds do we do so i would say very simply fellows sorry gotta move back now when they build those cars trucks and parts they send them over no tax no nothing and theyve come up with a new scheme illegals are gonna drive the cars over because no true its true because it just works so nobodys gonna check up just drives beautiful probably keep them and just live happily for the rest of their lives in the united states you know but we have to do something about it now lets say jeb bush as president hes a stupid person i dont think i dont know what do i but lets say hes president and you know its wrong hes gonna say no no no we dont want the ford we dont want to go with judge attacks because you know the way you do it you just say judges and then hes going to be hit by his lobbyists they gave a million shares got a hundred and thirtyfive forty million dollars i dont have anything i dont want anything i dont want money im just taking a little small contributions for people to send me in what the woman since and i was so in love with a beautiful letter so its amazing i like that possess like an investment that adds up to the fuel for the plane trip to iowa ok it all does but who cares i dont want them because i dont want to be controlled last week you heard me say this i turned down million dollars by a big lobbyists not a bad person you know tough guy not a bad person but he gives me five hes not doing that because he thinks i have beautiful hair not that then and it is my hair and is my hair it is that is actually people dont know that i proved that you know in alabama was really hot it was raining and i added a lot to do that but but ghetto so we we would go over and the lobbyists would say no we gave you millions of dollars mister president and you owe it to the lobbyists and after about minutes you just hope i cant really do that they really helping my campaign with me because i know all these guys but they never did it because i dont want their money i earn the money that i turned down so much money i feel like such a stupid person know its true first time my life i feel stupid does it give me offering me millions like to give you five million dollars i could have it right now and i turned them down i go back as im doing the right thing fact how about i just take a vote how about if i take all this money and promised i swear to you that i wont do anything for these people what about that no thats you know thats the way it has to be because i think one of the things i like about me is gonna buy me nobodys gonna fight and alright so after about minutes bush goes out and it says right you could build a plant built it up so i please how dare me i mean it was so terrible that even thought about doing that you know because you contributed money ok me different i dont want you in mexico mexico i love the mexican people i have thousands of mexican people that have worked for me over the years and even to this day i mean i love the hispanic the spirit i love them very credible people but we have leaders they can compete with the leaders do leaders are to spark so i would say that they had a ford sorry im not going to approve tax what every car and every truck in every part that comes across that southern border you tax ok thats whats gonna happen and this is too easy i dont need any of the killers that its going to get them anyway but this is too easy this is like this is this is taking candy from like that beautiful little baby ok so easy so what happens is they didnt say no no no and if people call me but these are people that i didnt take any money i didnt take anything i dont want their money so that people call me and i wanna see that here and i know theyll be friends of mine maybe ill say im not address it and i would say lets say this whole process starts at noon i would say by four oclock in the afternoon the head of ford will call me and say mister president weve decided to build in the united states that will happen will happen if theyre really tough wait till the next day but i guarantee you by five oclock the next day that theyre back and thats great thats what we need we need jobs we cant keep giving out our jobs you know college debt i go over now and i see the vets are mistreated in this country so badly believe me you know they didnt like the most popular person with the vets you know i built the vietnam memorial in downtown manhattan ok and if its like me a lot and they did a poll and people were shocked this is why we would you be shocked cuz im gonna take care of the other one college college debt its out of control and i go around and i see students and by the way you see whats happening with the colleges i mean you talk about like what theyre doing the prices of these colleges the way theyre rapidly raising and students are borrowing money from different bit but also from the government the only thing that the government makes money on college students thats true then making a lot of money in college yet and the big thing we need is jobs and its students come up to me and they say mr trump bombard i cant i cant even i dont know however paid off this is somebody thats a junior or senior in college and they they its almost like they have no hope it to me its one of the saddest things ive seen in making the rounds is college students college debt and they say and then apply for jobs one was tell me from a very good actually college in iowa where i was great college and they were saying you know i worked hard i became a great student i thought i just became one of the top students in my class i cant get a job and a lot of a pink jobs so now they have the debt and they cant get because china has a judge in japan has a job and so many other places we dont have jobs so they get out and theres no place to go and in a way to do it were gonna solve the problem because were back to jobs from china and we gonna bring back to judge from japan there but if you look at the deficit the trade deficit that we have with china people somehow get a balanced budget like they can some good deals with china and japan look at the trade deficit i was in los angeles two weeks ago i saw ships that were soaping ive never seen anything like it with cars from japan it pouring off we sell them actually you so chief this is one of the benefices beef but honestly if you have a look at the difference numbers here its so its so crazy we said we may send cars we said we have great relationships with these people you know the amazing thing every country in the world thinks that the united states is represented by stupid people and their right now theyre all very stupid people and every country in the world in every country in the world everybody makes money and a funny thing is we dont get along with anybody here we have here we have deals are all bad and everybody elses i just came in and im watching on television that will really in a very bad place with russia now were working on the ukraine and i think thats fine but why is it europe sort of like leading that hold charge why we always leave me when working and i think its terrible thats a lot of problems with sending an f ran to gorge and when we have fighters are best military people are going over there and were worried about you create i think i think its weird but you know germany is over the germanys far richer than we are germanys made a fortune we protect germany for no money can we protect south korea for no money so germany is over there right and then did not but obamas talking about the ukraine ukraine germany sitting right let let these dopey people that care and all the european country so is sending a fight is now in north korea you have a situation where you know hes raring his head again i just ordered four thousand television sets a big job that i did and theyre all made in south korea dont make him in iowa i wish anybody make televisions they dont make them anywhere in this country samsung lg its all of it right there are from south korea sonys from japan is good but but just paid a fortune saying they make a fortune look at the deficit that we have with south korea i love south korea level these countries but why is it that we protect them so this guy raises his head nuclear weapon we have been at least we have troops over there right now which is nothing compared to the median that they have in north korea bigamy ok what we do and you know how can we please were watching the ukraine were watching south korea will watching germany while watching japan we protect your pin we have a treaty with japan if japan gets attacked we have to immediately go to the red ok if we get attacked japan doesnt have to help us with this deal thats the kind of deals with no no thats the kind of deals they have nothing to do but if they get a text we have to go over to japan i yeah yeah yeah so so we need smart people and we can straighten this country out we can make this country so so we can make it better than ever in my we can make it better than ever saudi arabia i love saudi arabia the people are very nice to me by my partner and she wouldnt believe it is true that pay me anything did nothing but money they have nothing but money i have a beautiful plane all of a sudden it doesnt look so good when i look at some of them im jealous terribly jealous arabia they make a billion dollars a day none offered as i was before the you know when that but now lets say to have a pretty good we protect them protection here we get nothing and every time if you think in yemen those folks who have to yemen then you leave the room right now cuz you not very smart young man did you ever see the border it never ends its just straight line it never ends and you know its on the other side saudi arabia the oil if you think this stopping at yemen be looking for the oil dont forget im the one im the most militaristic person i would build a military so strong so powerful so incredible nobody would ever use it nobody would ever happen we would never have to use it i would have the best everything you know we have a military where we give to the allies are allies were given to the wrong allies by the way you know that we give it to the wrong house we dont give to the kurds we give two people one bullet shot near humvees armorplated the best in the world so i heard they left in one day they abandon said no no no you man armorplated the best in the world tom these because one shot was fired in the air these are the people helping these are the people helping and now the enemy has the humvees armorplated we have the ones where did not armorplated and our wounded warriors who are the greatest people we have in this country that the greatest the greatest and our soldiers are protected and the enemy is because they have these great vehicles that they talk and thats just the humvees you could go into everything they have the best equipment we have so we have to get smart and we have to know what were doing and i would build im telling you i am so into it but in and and culture noses in as much as i am into the military i love and respect im a huge fan of general patton im a huge fan of general douglas macarthur to this day he has the highest marks a person i believe in like marks and education i think its great general douglas to this day has the highest grades in the history of something nice nice thing we have to do something and we have to do it since we have to get the generals that there was a general one uses name but hes leaving and they said to him the other day about isis on television well what do you think about isis can we beat them i dont know i dont know i dont know its going to be very hard very hard to be nice and i can you imagine george patton saying it would be hard to be hit have am not down about three days and he say wheres the next country where we go from here where where general douglas macarthur getting out with this corn cob pipe right out of the airplane looking over the land that he just took can you imagine him going to get too busy fighting they want to win the two busy winning we dont have winners anymore winners of this country have winners now speaking of winners will know about trade weve covered it its horrendous im gonna get the greatest negotiate a treaty can make a lot of money would be great if we have the love in business week magazine again they had a story of the things the chinese most want now whos tougher in the chinese the night i love them i respect i just take what they do it was tough for them to ten things one of the things as anything trump apartments and we wanted to see how could that be possible because maybe they respect me or maybe they respect us i dont know anything from ok so we gonna be respected were gonna be really respect we should have gone to iraq we did we made a mistake when we went out we should have kept the oil and you would have ice is the leading you wouldnt have it now people say oh that such a harsh statement he said take the oil to help the iraqi government is totally corrupt isis is just formed out of iraq so we should be done in and then the way obama got out was a total contestants and then i said total catastrophe and i said reuters july i said dont go in because if you do that to iraq and im one that wants to be like id love i love the strength to use it in the right location if you do that youre going to allow iran to take over the could you gonna decapitate there were two powers or equal did fight that go ten c c c they rest this goes on for decades ago right am i right so we decapitate one of them now i ran is as we speak meeting with iraq to take over the country and you know whos getting the oil most of the oil the stuff that i systems in china you know that china is getting so much oil and getting you know we get nothing thousands of lives wounded warriors while of all over two trillion dollars we have nothing in afghanistan which a lot of people dont know is very rich in minerals oil and minerals with fighting in afghanistan and a very amazing mountains and regions with fighting in afghanistan over here and on the other side of the mountain they have massive from china that taken out all the minerals as we we need people that are smart we have people that dont get it look at the deal we have with a look at this deal is going to in my opinion lead to an arms race the likes of which there has never been countries are going to line up for dokes you gonna have perhaps nuclear proliferation you gonna see things that you have never seen take place in a short period this is a deal that just the other day it was determined after months hell take so long to go on forever they had all prisoners we never asked for a prison about that having a deal is good but we should have doubled and tripled up the sanctions and negotiated from strength to dinner so instead we have carried that goes on bicycle races the price increases years old and i said it the last time i spoke i swear to you i will never enter a bicycle reserve on president islip islip he is in a bicycle race she falls you breakers like this is our chief negotiators walked in and they look at a bike wattage i watched actually on charlie rose i watched a chief negotiator being interviewed by charlie and have minutes i tweeted donald trump tweeted i said this guy is too smart for caring so we have to get the prison and you know what the excuse well we didnt ask them we didnt want to make the deal too complicated think of it theyre fighting us in yemen we didnt ask anything about you dont find us day wait period so if we think theyre doing nuclear we have to wait days but see thats not the worst part the worst part is that clock doesnt start ticking could be much as a whole process i mean they could build and build a couple of more shoot and by that time we still wouldnt be in their check in fact i can just see them sweeping up the floor painting at battleship grey you know when i was with my father used to paint garages battleship way it always like that would you do know what i mean by battleship grey shiny battleship grey i can just see him doing it so what we doing this crazy so you have that and then the beauty of all and you heard it two days ago after years we just found out that theyre going to do in the most important section didnt do their own inspections to get around to do their own inspections did you hear about this one looks so many guys did you where the hell have you been for the last three guys three days ago i heard nobody knew they are going to self inspect it is unbelievable that it is another part we gotta give them a hundred and fifty billion dollars plus and even if the deal is approved they get that no other way they get that regardless you know when i do a deal when i buy something that came when i buy the product whatever the deposit and right when the deal closes with paying them even if the deal doesnt happen id never heard this one before i dont know who came up with the idea of us have been carried no we must because i dont think the iranians you know the iranian spurgeons a great negotiate the natural great negotiate i dont believe they would have even thought of this because its so crazy no true they wouldnt have actually said lets do this because its so far out who would ever think of it they get a hundred and fifty billion plus plus even if the deals voted down into the deal doesnt happen which they will probably happen because we have a lot of weak people that are going to prove that just like their probe obamacare you know you elected people though in a knockout obamacare they got to washington something happen i promises im gonna happen if something happens in washington they get elected they are really gonna do a job theyre all enthused and obamacare were gonna fight to end this horrible thing with the five billion dollar website that doesnt work to this day by the way i billion i have about websites like nicholas me three dollars and they work and go to washington they look at these beautiful buildings and all of a sudden they become an appropriate word i think so they become just it doesnt work but those two together something happens and look where im working on a car parts of course i gotta vote for obamacare is no wonder what im doing but they got elected to not get out what happened to these people what happened so something happens when people get elected and go to washing the beauty of washing im building as you know president obama is in charge of government services were tremendous people by the way they really are theyre very talented people thats because it kills me they didnt choose me probably would be saved but they are talented people theyre great people and were doing a great hotel where the greatest hotels i think itll be one of the greatest hotels anyone but everybody wanted it one of the most soughtafter pieces of property rights back on pennsylvania between congress and the white house best location for the real estate people they know this like any time you get a post offices could get to the post office was always defers the old post office in washington d c so its being converted to trump international hotel gonna be great and just take it then i got it from the obama administration what were doing a great job and heres the thing were ahead of think of this compare this to government were way ahead of schedule and under budget you know we have a great country we have a country with tremendous potential the potential to the people of the potential we have great people we have problems all over the place but their problems that can be solved we have to incentivize people we have to give people spirit when president obama was elected one thing i thought would happen i really thought he would be a unifier you look at baltimore you look at ferguson you look at st louis the other night you look at chicago you look at so many different places and you look at whats happening with the africanamerican youth its never been a worship never you look at whats happening with so many other aspects of our country and theres a racial divide theres a divide period this hatred all over the country ive never seen it like we have to unify the country we have to spirit eyes we have to create jobs we have to do a tremendous amount of work but it could be done quickly i will say this if the right person is not elected come next year i dont know if it can be brought back again no matter how competent and capable the person too good to be true far down the line thats going to be too far down the line just in closing and you dont normally i do questions but this has been such a good time and everyones had heard such a brilliant speech you know i was with elton john elton john deter do anybody like a lot of times like theyll do this last song and its so great its so unbelievable the places standing and going incredible and then theyll be like to come back to like three boys and three rd is good and people go good lets get out of here alice so you know you like to leave on a high note and i just like this but i have a thank you i love you too thank you but but you know i have a statement i say it all the time and i told the story once before and its that the american dream is dead but im gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever

its me a hundred percent through the ratings came out they were so big and so much it was the biggest trading in the history of cable television or something like that and you know i was little be used but thats ok so what happens if its not me that i should go to cnn during the next debate and i should say to jeff zucker a great coach jeff im gonna do the debate but i want two million dollars

you very thank you very much beautiful nice facility nice facility they said theyve never had anything like this before i should we went to places and every time would sign up it was so many more people than we thought it was just an amazing experience and you know we all started in phoenix where i had that big event we had a big event thank you thank you i love you i love you folks you know we all want the same thing we want to make america great again i mean its like the same less sure nobody wanted to be less i know but nobody is this threat is a very a political crap now we had a little debate so ill bet you they get big ratings that unites all that then as soon as youre ready to go through the roof i think next time i wont do it i wanna maybe not do the next debate just to see it but these debates have been become super bowls in a sense its been amazing you know that last cycle no network even one of the debates they were considered a wasteland nobody watch it very few people watching and now fox had million when shes now actually higher with the final numbers but million the largest ever and cable television cnn at million the biggest event in the history in terms of numbers in terms of people watching in the history of cnn cnn all fairness they cover wars they cover last two different things some problems some big events in the history of cnn million according to cnn was the biggest event theyve ever had and you know what i get out of it nothing not safe and thank you thank you for years ago nobody did you remember that have a choice anybody even watch so we have to take advantage of all weekend you know so last night was interesting because i made a place so much easier someone shes here you know its hard to say either run as an independent and say you know i just got a poll where im at doesnt make a lot of sense audit colleagues now and you know its amazing to me amazing you know i did meet the press couple of months ago and i was doing ration of number one by the way since i went there all talking about it in the history of politics they say this isnt me its the people who i dont trust worth and but yeah i go through this all the time and he always said although today i think the fact that i did bill oreilly had no choice but to follow but they never show the crash says you know that right i always talk about go home i did you have many people because they just dont show the quest to show my face they never show that unless and i used to think the cameras were like fixed that they can you know modern cameras a lot of they dont work like the old cameras right and then all of a sudden will have like a protester in the back corner and you see these cameras twisted like a pretzel is unbelievable but i think to look at all of them back they look at those cameras they are the worst people oic the worst very just under percent sure very good but you have soooo many dishonest reporters i ive never said in fact its almost amazing to me cause i consider myself to get the worst publicity and yet i got this message lead and it tells you two things theyre just honest and the people are really smart they will get stories that is so bad and then come back mr trumps are you opposed just went up seven points out that be possible people get it they know the presses design has its a its all big john job so its one of those in fact in phoenix you remember the crowd was anybody right it was like this it was we had fifteen thousand people they reported it as your thousand than and then whats his name but he said shes done so now hes gone he he lost it when he said killer is fine with a message is not fine with that was really breaking the law folks ok so he doesnt get big crowds anymore but he was there a little bit before or after his pitches his dad mike his grad was much later than mine in a lot of people but it was much lighter and they say it wasnt rough that it matters but its justice on the street of those things ok now last night so i had jet come at me you know low energy now im standing there and all of a sudden i hear this in a dog like he just the way his pollster told him to say that i hit back very very hard but look we need strong people we need scharping we are being kill we are being beaten by everybody were not winning anymore knightridder stuff i say we are winning anymore we dont live on trade we dont win against the military are vets are being mistreated so badly a tolerable horrible so i just want to go over there so here we are ready theyre complaining ashley dont complain youre going to be the only ones that he was going to see on television you know in a certain way down the best location youll be happy tonight when you watching youself on television show last night they do all these polls and its great they pull everything you know its amazing to me the candidates go out and spend hundreds of thousands of posters right i dont i get a lot of money and it doesnt matter i like unlimited campaign and yet now figure this this this so jet bush to this point has spent over forty million dollars per its hes at donald trump told this point has spent i dont even know why i spent it i think i wanted to give something number one by a lot by points im a lot of things when it be nice if we could do that for a country so i spent the leash and i have the best result id like our students where were number one in the world by far in terms of cost per pupil and when number in the world ok youre right i think i like that guy right but not think of it because its like the reverse so i spent the least not gonna spend a lot of money but i was going to add up to this point million dollars i thought id need to spend you know what do i know and these guys you know as much as i cant stand of the kidney oldest free publicity right by putting that on people would get sick to sell my god we had the whole program and now we have it we actually please dont put the yet we actually called network please dont put that it you know they cut you short stroll hour and then every minutes they have an ad for truck doesnt work so i was going to have million up literally right up to this point and i spent nothing i havent spent anything but were ready to spend i mean were ready to spend and we could spend a lot and i think were gonna win ohio well we just came out where were leading in iowa now which is a great place but i love because it just came out drudge now this is with people right registration alqaida stretch great guy hes a great guy so they do these online polls with hundreds of thousands of people so they dont somebody was not reliable baby trump hundreds of that you think im gonna have to sit there make hundreds of thousands of phone calls and then they reported anyway if i win because of my window we bought it they have these guys like george will you fall asleep listening to discuss it in a way the little spectacle she wouldnt even be bright nobody would think this is george i mean i gotta tell you brad henry terrible he is so unfair to me he is the worst he is the worst and im not allowed to criticizes im going to be very nice crowds have a terrible hes terrible you have a guy named steven hayes i never even heard of this guy when my name is mentioned just like hes up lily goes crazy now part of the reason is they all said i was never gonna run by and then i ran this other file formats basically a single page when you signed your life away and i went like this lets go then they said well maybe hes not as rich as everyone thinks hell never file as financial and if he does hell file a min two years from now youll a lot of extensions i filed ahead of schedule in less than days almost a hundred pages and of presleys down there they said theyd never seen anything like it they was cowering does believe me i want to be running unless i was really rich as they would it kill it and they end by the way you havent read what report that i built a great company i dont a tremendous company very little detriment to schedule the best asus and the only reason i say im not saying because it sounds terrible in a certain way i dont want to break but thats the thinking we need in this country we have trillion in debt we have trillion dollars in debt we built the story gas station in afghanistan and it doesnt even spell the right gas ok million you think you can build a gas station for slightly less now you look at the things the money we spend a billion dollars to build a hospital i mean you could build seven hospitals so that we could take care of her for money we have such still people leading us i used to say theyre incompetent i didnt want to use the stupidest to crude they dont know i went to an ivy league school i really like a smart guy my uncle is at mit was a professor for years they didnt believe it they went to check dr john i actually think you was there for five decades mit was one of the great engineers scientists and you know its like really good but when they talk about us they talk about us like we know the smartest people these are the people that made our country great originally these are the great people great people and were going to take our country back and were gonna turn it around and were gonna run it smart theyll run duran listen to this and this just heard this morning so we give a hundred and fifty billion dollars to her and they self inspect their big site though it will make it into their cell can you imagine you call them we are you making news ok well the shack that call dumps and then this think of this and then they have to day where i have days before the clock starts ticking you have to go through all processes can be forever before you get there and you know the other thing look at it its more important than anything and have a good deal is good for him i could just tough it is but another thing that gets more prisoners they wouldnt even get him out so ive been complaining about this from a long before they did the deal yet the prisoners out so now the deal is done and what do i hear this morning on television that were now starting a brand new separate negotiations with the procedures and a what many prisoners that we have over here for the four think about it think about it now think about it so now they want to start a whole new negotiation that we should have three years ago when this stupid negotiations began you go any said before we start we want to preserve as they say no we say thats ok you leave the room you double up the sanctions they call you back within hours i dont say you got your prisoners think of it we just gave them the greatest deal what are the greatest just in the history of countries we made them a powerful rich nation they going to now have nuclear energy and have to waste their time making it with the money we gave them they can buy nuclear why they gonna make it they can buy whatever they want you dont think north koreas probably calling help help help we need money will give you some milk we are thus we are led by the stupidest people have ever so i cant even imagine so now heres the thing i want i can even watch it i cant even listen to it so now they want to do a new negotiations for the prisoners and all we had to do said we want and they want a lot and one of the guys said from her n we want a lot it drives all of us thats why were here you know they used to talk about the silent majority will not silent anymore folks hillary clinton is a disaster shes going to be just as god forget her and obama helped get us into this mess with the migration highways lets go into libya lets go his house shes doing she wakes up in the morning i will not say that she puts her pants suit because thats what she does im not gonna say im not saying it i will not say that she wakes up in the morning she goes out shogun a new hampshire one day a week something you havent notice should do something totally stage of it for people shes always sitting around a little plastic table theres like four people nice people out of a thousand people they fit the floor nice as yesterdays really innocent questions and that she believes that she goes back to sleep for a week and im telling you ill tell you were in the foxhole just came out and the fox hole was very strong that aidid hurt easily by peter easily and and honestly honestly and look what i did the bush i havent even started on hillary bush here now hes doing another commercial use negative commercials on me hes doing a commercial where he is what he said last night but he doesnt put what i said to him and what it is and its a big problem in terms of running for office because you know these super pacs are scam there is a horrible thing that totally corrupt one of the super pacs it was written about last week in los angeles times a race six million dollars by the time all of these guys took their cut they ended up with a hundred and forty thousand dollars left with a campaign thats better than thats better than being a real estate broker right right we have so many things we can do and ill tell you the thing i really look forward to doing some of the people in this age i really like you saw last night that ted cruz was very nice to me and i was nice to him actually most of the people most of the people were nice to me last time it was pretty good you know i went in this stuff to you because i heard all of them are going to come out right fourteen of them were gonna be coming up and i was prepared but i said this could be unpleasant international millions of people and out of the the jet that i guess rand paul just an average chance by the way what is rand paul doing you know whether you like his politics and his father had a certain spark right you know there was a little sparkle red doesnt have that spark ran doesnt have this book and i love kentucky is one of the great places but i dont get it you know how to get reelected in kentucky i dont get it i dont know is he gonna be primary is somebody gonna run against him as we do want a republican but you gotta be primary something but hes a guy but the father had a spark and he had something special like this but he had something special rain doesnt have a choice other than those two and it was really even occasions surprised hes gotten beaten up pretty badly said you know what its easier to be nice to truck right its easier less costly but he was nice and we had a good show drudge thats had a fifteen people so that means i got percent time magazine believe me i dont control too i was on the cover for five weeks ago they should pick before the first of the year but they did you know its coming from me that these panels and virtually and i said im never gonna get it because im not establishment but every panel that i saw on television when time was even though the magazines going down the tubes and so does the cool thing most magazines are going down into a fair to say that its great to watch these guys go down the tubes but you know what time magazine so that straddles and five people around you know all the political battles and almost everybody even my enemy said no trouble getting his hes done something thats ever been done before they have been done before folks and were really doing is really a movement what were doing is a movement so they said drugs gonna win i said i love my wife i said im done never do it its just like the apprentice for the first three seasons i shouldve gotten the apprentice got the number one got tremendous ratings it was the hottest thing i did pick these shows that were established amazing race you fall asleep watching their operations are sleeping because of that establishment hollywood im not as that should politically showtime magazine a woman whos destroying germany she let the migration come right into german shes destroying germany and if i have to work with her little while do just fine but im telling you what she did was wrong they should have done a safe zone in syria had a big beautiful fat safe zone and stop all this nonsense and i honestly if you work for obama and hillary you probably wouldnt have even had the migration they are so incompetent time magazine time magazine charities that come usnews and will be put pbs public radios pbs this is who want it is the blaze well he doesnt like me very much its ok who cares i dont even know who he is very milos washington times trade paper cbs philadelphia fox las vegas thats what it is i mean you know by the way i just read i just read every single home those are all the online post and wanted a bit and then youll watch hes actually did what you know when youre on television you tend to watch no matter who you are but i went home and i must say for the most part even the haters they thought he did well one or two said well i think you have a particularly great night these people are brutal but who cares so what are the reasons weve done so well here is because we are going to stop illegal immigration you have to we have to if we dont stop it we dont have a country folks we dont have a country we dont have a country and you know i have his big hard as anybody here i have his big hard as anybody its like with the migration help them lets do something but we cant let them come over almost more important than anybody did you see yesterdays story about cell phones and flags and also to beheadings and trying to pictures on their cell phones first of all people in a migration having cellphones that was the first question i mean who trade for those cell phones where they coming from who they call it these days people can you imagine many many many cellphones why where do they get cell phones who pays a monthly bill what are they go dont they get filled by the phone company or something how i guess you know friend of mine said you know they have flags and he was talking about the isis legs and also the beheadings and everything so but i should something different wow i never thought of that you right now they have cellphones so were not letting them come in and if they are here when i get here theyre all going back they have to they have to back so were going to mexico is going to pay for the wall and i love mexico and i love the mexican people in a style that works for me and theyre incredible workers with incredible spirit and a lot of me and ill tell you why in the state of nevada they recently did a poll and im leaving with a strategy because im going to produce jobs im going to take our jobs back from china and japan and mexico and all these other places and you know what extent are here legally and that got went through a process those people are all that for me because they dont want their jobs taking they dont want their house taken they dont want to be overrun by people pouring across the borders and one of the first thing i do probably the first thing i do is the good thing about an executive order whats a good thing i could walk inside and thats the end i have to go through congress obama never goes to congress you know it just isnt credible so im a republican but im so disappointed the republicans when we got majority when we got majority did you think it would be different some guy or woman gets elected they go through how were gonna stop obamacare when a repeal it and refine i am going to do that violates gonna be debt not to worry too much its gonna die in seventeen unless the republicans work out a rescue plan which will probably do if im not there i will tell you obamacare is dead in seventy you know the wrong people are signing up its almost doctors are leaving i have a friend he said dr hes a young guy hes leaving the profession he said i have more accountants and have nurses more italians emerges so anyway we are going to take care of obamacare were gonna get rid with it and make this place is going to be unbelievable and it should go fast but ill tell you what can happen we cant go through another four years of this company and stupidity weekend which we cant do it so what do you get rid of that but the wall is so important and you know it does work all you have to do is ask your friends in israel it works its really effective but i need to trump all i dont mean a wall that you will not go over you can get through i mean height of this building how high you still here man travis how i just cause youre talking about a little bit higher than that meaning if you get up there man is no way to get them and its gonna be a beautiful wall because someday theyll name in afternoon i wanted to be viewed through a straw and is going to work and to have people come in when you have a particular people come in but they gonna come in legally the company only and was gonna bring our country back into its really having a huge impact and you know one of the people that ive got enough got in there so many people students and professors and college has caused you know student debt used to work in that way to work and everything works on everything i mean theres nothing we can work on this is nothing in this country guy said last night at a lot i wouldnt want to be the enemy and have a lot of those suckers coming we just dont know how to use it we dont have the whole thing is different but one of the people that have gotten to know whos one of the great great people the illegal immigration has caused tremendous crime has caused tremendous debt its caused economic hurt as you know because a lot of jobs are being taken and and our citizens and get those jobs and again we have people come in and when you have if there are certain areas like a great period i know a lot of the folks up there and they say you if we can get will do some of these programs we get people up were not gonna hurt industry we dont want to hurt businesses will get people will get the people in it are people dont want to take the job and i have said that you know theres people that dont want certain jobs and i get it but were going to get the people that make this country so dynamic my tax plan on cutting the hell outta taxes for the middle class businesses and business corporations are gonna bring the trillions of dollars in arab side of the country theyre gonna bring into the use of here but one of the people i got to know and hes a friend of mine and he had a horrible thing happens his son neil shah you may have seen him its just been amazing and whatever is around us into me a favor say a few words will explain what happened with an illegal immigrant who killed his son viciously and violently and you become a friend of mine and hes here with us and let me bring about jimmy has come on daily street dog by an illegal alien gang banger street gang banger he was on his third gun charge now we hear people talking about banning guns but you have an illegal alien on his third gun charge never been deported he was released he was in jail for assault with a deadly weapon battery on a peace officer resisting arrest ok eight months in the county jail for that for months early that day he got out there were according to the sheriff but then in la county he said that she know gang member to legal aid gangs and gang members the shaft collars ordered him out into the streets to say they get out because you want to be a liability so the same day he got out he was told to go in my neighborhood plastic you must learn was with me and myself went to love football training in pasadena and he was getting recruited from stafford virginia texts i mean it was really beautiful thing you know i mean we did seventeen years of hardcore

cant fix day i was but i have a another seventeen years old he was a twotime now hes date me know you owe your brother now you know and his release a truck was only person to have reached out to me out of all the politicians of the black politicians have a nobody cares its all about illegal aliens i care about you dont care about us as americans throw to first we need that he is he is this is why do we have to be under the suppression radians and their duty and american dream and we can american nightmare you know its not fair and only way you can see is without a truck i dont see no the way it was there it would happen before going on that hes here and we have to make sure it happens and safe and we stand in the way i do because i believe that he was just thank you is amazing is amazing so many colleges wanted to son as he was a good student who was a great football player and camille broke his hand hitting a concrete was so upset and so you know you could imagine is just a very amazing guy and with an amazing family put some of the members of his family over sister and his mother and its just we gave me right in that plane he said i said have you written in one like that he said not yet i said you can ride it whatever you want but he is a special man believing gotta take care of our people we gotta take care of us so were going to straighten things were going to take trade back from china within a make money now last year we had a trade deficit of over billion dollars with china and then we honored china and we have nothing but problems that they dont do anything with us in north korea they have total control over north korea talking about i ran a red have to worry about under president they wont have to promise you that doesnt matter what the agreement said im at the violate that agreement slightly you dont mind you they will have to but china we have tremendous power of china but we all know that because we have people that had no business going to have to do is look at the iran deal will weaken them two hundred and fifty billion dollars at all of those things thats right the art of the deal they are the man my man over there good ill try signing thank you but we have to do something we have to use our hedge so we have a year in trade deficit shy and we have way over big hit with av dollars here trade deficit with japan with mexico the number is enormous thats why these politicians get up the other day and they said will never build the wall of course they will make it a fortune to was peanuts compared to what they make it but you have to know they have no business ability whatsoever and i like they have no business ability whatsoever and some like jeb bush and others are not strong enough they dont have the power they dont have whatever it takes they dont have it and you know what i dont want to be a nasty guy but i dont care anymore we have to get the right people and i dont care i dont care and we can have a continuation of the stupidity of this in companies we cant do it well we have caroline kennedy negotiating trade pact with japan i want carl icahn i want the killers of wall street to do it and they all want to do it they dont want anything they wanted their ego makes you want to do it some of them actually love the country and you know what some of them are not nice people who cares who cares so were gonna take factory was gonna take bank jobs you know we dont we have lost so much if you look at what hey everybody beaches but china is really dont have been talking about this for

tremendous excavator and he buys a lot of equipment and he always put capital by the way i look whats happened to that shocked and i was telling the story year ago so i predicted it just like i wrote that osama bin laden in my book the america we deserve i read about osama bin laden in the year before the world trade center get knocked down its pretty good right but hes an excavator me these very

but they cut the ending manipulated the currency could do anything else i owed it to myself and my family i could do anything else about it thats whats happening and i see it and look at caterpillar stock i should just two years ago look whats happening jarred come our companies are being decimated by currency manipulation and we have politicians that dont even know what the words mean we have a politician that wont even talk about radical islamic terrorism you will not issue the term and how you solve a problem if you dont want to even talk about it and ive had friends of mine that i muslims i have great relationships with bushs i have partnerships with was and they called me up the other day they said not all of them but they called me up some very prominent and they say you have done a tremendous service at all im doing is we have to figure out folks what the hell is going on we have some really bad stuff happening and they called me up and they said donald youve done as the service you really have done a great service and i was surprised to hear him say it but they dont much more than we do have a problem and weve got to solve the problem but you cant solve the problem if you

states can you believe this can you believe it you know in the old days my daughter was anybody have a great person but she said you know daddy when she was in europe as a little girl she said a lot of things were made in the usa this a made in the usa and that was quality and i remembered as some of you remember it made in the usa detonated japan that was cheap stuff that we have made in japan level it was garbage now its like you dont see i dont even though we have sides say made in the usa i havent seen them do they use that side of the ball and she said in czechoslovakia which was communist they would take a dollar bill and people would scotch tape it to the windshield of the car because there was so amazed and so proud of america they just wanted any civil and they take dollar bills and scotch tape because they had i guess two words that pride and respect for our country we dont have that anymore without respected by anybody anymore thats why we have tragic this look everywhere i go im crowds like this everywhere everywhere we have the biggest crowds by four because this isnt just like lets go and have a good time somebody said oh trucks and great entertainers at a lot of books yet ill tell you we have a message we have a message and the messages we dont want to let other people take advantage of this i was we have rebuilt china weve rebuilt it you go to china

people to people that i want you know i dont care of a guy like jeb bush never do it wouldnt bother me at all i think its a negative if you will but i have guys like carl icahn a great business guy we need those guys have to go and put the ags to work and she always how great their nobody can beat our business people have the greatest in the world but we dont use them we use political hacks we use donors we used special interests of make deals in order that their companies and their countries are taken care of thats what we do so you know im selffunding ok im sofa im putting up my own money i

they can never get more so than me because i know how to do it i gotta get these guys every one of them said youll never get to me its easy when they said no one gonna make it three hours so you not everybody should be able to negotiate with them as well i dont want to sit and watch a three hour debate to ours is better i could debate for hours for help once the lights for three hours so they said youll never be able to get out of innocent guess i will i called ahead of cnbc minutes and we had a twohour debate so here it is folks in a nutshell the trade stuff is easy and i i thought so much fun jump eres tu vienes tires not this country but say paris and by the way its none of those people that were slaughtered in paris with many more going to die that decimated their there as we have in california more going to die there in very bad shape we have dead more going to get some of those people paris probably the number one place in the world for gun control paris and french you have a gun unless youre a bad guy you can view on it some of those people had a goal or a gunshot right up into their way oregon right over here jess and i guarantee you the result would have been a hell of a lot better would have been a hell of a lot better talk to some people especially from liberal new york city everythings democratic national gun control but i said supposing im talking with people very successful people but their control and im the exact opposite i think i think its no great see you debate them and they know that yet when the debate but they still dont change in with your second amendment has to be and strengthen but it has to be we cannot let them take that away from us and believe me theres a movement to take it away and as a new movement is bullish they want to take bullets away if i become president and believe me you can relax nothings gonna be happening ok nothing is going to be a car we have to bring our education back locally will save a fortune we want the parents like you and you say it i see it in your eyes we want the local people to take care of their kids education as opposed to bureaucrats in washington but i see guys like bush and others that are very common core just a way of taking care of your friends what that is is bureaucratic nightmares that people couldnt care less about your children may be some of them do but a lot of them really just care about how much money they gonna make a month or a week at bringing education back locally i told you before we spent more per pupil by far number second isnt even close so obviously is not working so we have a lousy educational system were gonna change it were going to bring it local and its going to be great and its gonna take place immediately itll go quickly quickly report suggested bringing back jobs i cant do that so easy its changed a little bit since parish that since california where a lot of the post it came out they say trump is number one on security trump is number one on terrorism and you know but as far as like these massive numbers on terrorism like everybody wants truck for the protection is a no idea what theyre doing its not political and its not its not politically correct but its really correct its gonna save everybodys like i had to think last night i talked about the internet so i see is using our internet much better than our people right even though we invented the internet using it so last night i said i want to infiltrate the internet but peoples freedom of speech do that this was that what they want to kill you well we dont know where these people coming from whether they come from they are using the internet show brilliantly the good news is we have people in silicon valley that a far better than they are we have to get them involved we had to get them engaged whether we knocked the hell out of their addictions them in the ice territories which by the way are getting larger by the day how long have i been saying the hell out of the royal right right three years and i wanted to give it to our wounded warriors in our vets and the families of people that we kill paramilitaries so strong and so powerful that nobodys gonna mess with us and well never have to use it its going to be cheap will never have to use it dont forget i was it gets the war in iraq and you see that they go back to because i could totally destabilize the middle east i was against it were gonna make our military so strong were going to take care of our vets gonna take care of their training horribly and its never been gallery three weeks ago set actually the vets are treated very well that she hadnt reached interstate three weeks ago we going to take care of our great veterans better than ever and we put in a plan and everybody loves it would take care of our vets wait getting rid of obamacare will come up with something that i will tell you i just hope you go out and about because we have a little structural problem republicans have a disadvantage election so unless its gonna be a movement type of event like i think is happening where we can actually run the whole we can run the table on but unless its going to be something like i see happening thousands and thousands of people something is going on and its beautiful to see ladies and gentlemen were going to make america great again better than ever before i love you i love you thank you thank you thank youthank you very much so nice so amazing so it it is so great to be with you tonight and this was a little tough weather so a couple of hours ago they said mr job by the way i love you more love you couple of hours ago theyre saying im sorry sir you gonna have to cancel your trip to you imagine they said its going to be too tough and to top the flying is dangerous its really its not exactly nice outside right i said i can do that now i cant to identify it was marginal i have got here so you know in as you probably heard in california theyre having a tremendous problem right now killed as of now and i guess theres one thats on the loose or theyre having a fight this is when we appreciate our grade beliefs and our law enforcement they dont get enough credit they should get it and youre always going to have some bad apples juicy and television no matter what business youre in the bank and everything else but i wanna tell you they do one hell of a job and when you see these shootouts when you see these shootouts i can tell you one thing i dont want to do it you dont wanna do it so we want to thank the police and law enforcement there and believable and with that being said i think could we have a moment of silence lot of people killed and in honor of those victims generally lets have a moment of silence okay thank you thank you so we have some really special people here the most powerful people there are black pastors youve been hearing a lot about it and we had some incredible times over the last few days and weve had great support it wasnt covered properly never does they are so designed as they but you probably read where large im i dont even know the number but a large group of black passes came to see me in new york and then add it was really great and one of them was doctor and pastor steve parson and she put together a group of endorsers all endorsers and i said well youre endorsing me im bringing you up for a couple of seconds im gonna say i dont know if these people want to be preached to tonight we want to hear about other things to steve you know can take over the whole nine not just you know thats ok but hes a great guy he was in new york with the others and i just used in all over television over the last couple of days and he is a beautiful guy so steve come on up with your friends come on up black ministers in india we have one token brother over there but i will say this dead people ask me why you endorse and download from my opinion hes the best and only one that can be hillary clinton st we got a win and one thing about damage up is easy winner to he knows how to create wealth can i get a man and as a black minister of estate in the inner city and i tell you we need jobs we need employment we need businesses and i tell you who better to help us help ourselves into a person he believed that this is a movement a movement and i believe that were in a situation now where this country called america is going to come back and be made great again in iraq has a wealth transfer of wealth and move it okay and then ill tell you one thing mr sharp is going to make this military strong again to take anybodys mess sometimes cities and can be pretty tough can be pretty tough it can also be rewarding and they get great rewards thank you very much and thank you still got a lot going on in this country and tweeted im on my way to manassas im on my way and here i go and precise said were going to virginia than with the juices you look at whats happening with our country and i said you know what you have sign considering we dont have good subject matter and we have really bad subject matter we dont want anymore we dont win we never win we dont win with the military we dont win with trade we dont win with deals any kind of deals i look at that are randall its one of the worst things ive ever seen think theyve already violated the deal you know that i dont know if you have you her theyve already violated the deal the ink isnt even dry ok its not even dry and they violated to deal so we dont do it anymore you you look at surprises race wise guy over here she says surprised youre right who said that sick and i want a very good very good so were going to start winning and big gonna win gonna win were gonna get rid of obamacare which is a disaster people involved with the whole obama thing and the democrats several problems over it because you know they voted and it was a fraudulent vote lets face it cuz obama lied to your senators and congressmen who happen to be democrats obama line times he said keep the doctor keep you plan to keep your everything everything is great is gonna be and then these guys got stuck with it and now they have to defend him and that i could be able to defend it and what did it go into a niggling but we have a plan to sell much better so much cheaper you look at whats happening with deductibles on obamacare and its out of control you dont use it if you get hit by a tractor maybe youll get a couple of bucks premiums have gone up and percent and just the other day and a lot of very good newspaper strictly and even in the bed once and there are plenty of these guys so dishonesty such dishonesty with the the mainstream media i will tell you such total dishonest but if you look at the if you look at over the last few days you seeing a lot of stories that obamacare is collapsing of its own way and and in unfortunately you know its gonna go now so that he has to straighten out but hes not going to straighten up correctly correct his a guy weve got ice and others that want to destroy us and hes worried about global warming and and he believes this and he believes god global warming he comes out all the time biggest problem is global warming and i say is this real are we living in the world you have people that want to blow up our cities wanna kill all of our people cutting off heads like no tomorrow in the middle east and bar were doing everything did drowning people in cages we havent seen anything like this since medieval times medieval times and read a chapter heads until you know you you just over the last couple of years ad and its true who ever heard of this this is a vicious group of animals and weve got to stop them and were going to stop them so strong and so fast so strong now one of the things i want to tell you this because a lot of you have heard mistaken you seen it was covered in live television they get ratings i as they get ready to make a fortune and i cant stand them and they cant stand me theyre always lying and not telling the truth but they always put me in a live televised nobody else those on the left television these other guys running for office a forcible they dont have crowds like this believe me they have because he has like people still he stands up be such thinking everybody falls asleep we can make a lot of money with him and the other ones if they have a hundred people its a lot every every place we have thousands and thousands this was all a restricted by the size of the room and we have talent stacked and the fire marshal i love with the fire marshal what he was so good to have a lot of people standing outside coming in the back right youre right man so but great people here great great people but we are going to just something thats a special because you know it was just mentioned movement what do you think the movement of said its a moment i didnt i never told him that he might have listened cos i used the expression sometimes but this is a movement i go to dallas where the mavericks plane had like the mavericks good players and the owner mark mark cuban has been great hes been great to see you know i have to tell you he said you want to use it use it and i was like on a thursday i said when said monday i said how many seats you have like twenty thousand we filled up in a day and a half we had we had time left over we had twenty thousand and dallas we had twenty thousand and oklahoma people in mobile alabama and everywhere we go and and i mean literally we go up to new hampshire we have crowds are many many many times the size of anyone else nobody has even close thank you man thank you man had school and i like that and it looks better without with that sort of ok had a hair wigs and i wouldnt say the greatest ever seen but its acceptable hey hasnt hurt him and me and say thank you very much not just an honor to be here but would it be so proud so i started this whole thing as you know in june and takes courage to run for president never done this before and ive selffunding my own campaign all these other guys like blood disgrace they totally control again and i could add a pack you know bush raised a hundred and twentyfive million dollars and hes dying in the balls rubia i i wont say it was so far a couple of him i like but thatll end because they all have to go through me as crews example crews been great to be a great point hes gonna have to say i get to attack him because otherwise im gonna come in second place in third place of something so theyve all got to attack and i love it when they take you so far everyone thats attacked me his gun thing go right down theyve got down big league i shouldnt say this in front of the best since brazil say thats not nice is that ok so like winning i mean its all about winning its really about make america great again thats when i today i read a big big card at home that everyones afraid to fight me because you know you look at very very nice man from texas right governor perry and he was so nice to me and all of a sudden one day ahead in the sense that he was vicious and violent went to washington made his speech the whole speech was about me for like a half an hour and i had to attack him and i attacked very viciously and i feel guilty not really i attacked you remember on the glasses and attacked him on the iq okay and then you have a guy like lindsey graham his a sitting senator and you go to south captured by the way his plan i know so much more than he does his plan is so bad it so its just remember that in the american wages i read that book in i wrote about osama bin laden we gotta take him out you gotta know where to use your power and i said and i dont know how many people show up in a couple of the announcers in the morning they said what was it so i had osama bin laden and the reason is i watching i listened and theres a big mouth who is very tall and i said wait a minute let me ask you i hear some friends his friends friends you know they dont think they do you know we want to be a unifier and we have to be a unifier we have to be funny thing is i do a great job with things and they will be a big beneficiary but maybe they just dont understand it yet maybe maybe the police could move them away so we can all hear ourselves george we have to have to there we have to thank you thank you thank you please sometimes and then please be gentle and then they say he is too soft you cant win if you could remove them as soon as possible police out there i think after the bill after the build up my game i think they gonna do a great job yeah we have to move them thank you thank you very much pouring in through them that coming in and and you know the saddest part you have a few people that thousands of people here and the media the headlines tomorrow will be protests right you know what we have and i say i saying in a sense strongly i used to use the term silent majority and determine use over the years and it really is people that have been abused and we have a majority but we dont know we have enjoyed it but its not a silent majority is really become a noisy majority its the noise you majority and thats okay thats okay because we have to be we have to be heard now folks because our country is going to hell we have a president whos incompetent ill tell you what this guy is grossly incompetent when i watch him taking all of this time and you know what i want clean air i want clean water i wanted to be a match and i want to be sparkling i want to be great i want so many environmental awards over the united develop a good im really a great development time a politician i meant he environmental awards and im proud of them i think its a great thing but its got its gotten out of control and this whole global warming thing you know they change and global warming climate change extreme weather the reason is its never sort of work in the extreme weather once about thats thats right you know you see i remember during the winter we had sort of a bad storm and they said oh wow this is global warming global warming and its unbelievable in the snow was all over the place and they said we havent had a stone out this was tired d number one snowstorm was in which blew everything out the window were gonna have you know like this like this and we do want we want clean air and we want clean water and other but its gotten to a point people are making a fortune off this stuff and our businesses are being hurt our manufacturers can compete giant is over there right now laughing like hell and barack obama because were stopping our plans from functioning and make it so expensive and not any better solution was so were stopping our plans were doing all of this damaged chinas agreeing to do things in may years from now and theyll violate the agreement hundredpercent because they always do just like a rand was just like everybody does well like the dummies like that just the dummies i we used to be so proud that we feel so stupid will let by stupid people and we can happen and we can happen any time believed by the way what im going to do is to take some questions in awhile you not to me it was brutal to get here today i might as well stick around for a while so so what was thinking about it in another few minutes to talk a little bit about what we have and i want to take some questions because i always thought i love it i love taking questions even if theyre vicious horrible violent questions will take them anyway one thing you know with hillary she doesnt have the strength of the stamina to be president she doesnt happen and i know i know i can look yesterday was a businessman one of the magazine cinema world class business been great im a great kisser i paid a fortune and i want to put that same thinking for the country all trillion dollars its gonna be trillion dollars very soon you see this ridiculous budget that was just passed like they passed it immediately nobodys fights i always say i know where the democrats are coming from but the republicans in a way a more disappointing because they go you elect him and you know what happens and let you add in virginia where the greatest upsets in full time and he deserved to be upset by the way you know hes back in bush that was the end of push can you believe that but it was one of the greatest up since i think it never happened before and you were so i mean you know what happens is they say we are going to end obama we are gonna make our military strong were going to take our pet sit within a makeup veg so happy everythings gonna be great while bob hall words you know its all talk no action politicians right and you love her and your own forum and they win their election and they go to washington i always say it and there with their wife or husband and they say look look mary we finally made it look at the beautiful look at the beautiful columns look at this this is like they go into the capital million they say this is this is now they have a vote on obamacare vote on camera but i dont want to leave this place is beautiful dont they let us down they left i promise you one thing if i win you say when were not always but i have to say look i am against fifty guys it was and was hours at its drying up then she know you guys with zero and they continue to go along time we cannot be good for them i mean you guys like pataki get elected dog catcher you have guys obviously you have guys that cant even if you think about it cant even the kick it one percent they cant get anything they actually had one of them down with a zero and an arrow pointing left nothing less than zero was on television i think thats a typographical error of some kind of less than zero but its like thats what it is and some of them didnt even register in upcoming stage and now theyve missed at times right theyve missed at times and i was told that this ten times well if god is willing to put up money because he knows hes not gonna win or you cant get enough signatures to register in a virginia or south carolina or new hampshire or wherever it may be but numbers of them havent registered why do we allow them to debate if somebody gives up to say to virginia or somebody gives up the state of south carolina because you know theyre pretty hard to get on the ballot they are by the way im already on the ballot i gotta thank you thank you just saying we helped you know we had so many many times the number of signatures we needed a lot and we did it so quickly who did it you did it right here stand up and take a pass but thank you honey im really great job i know that if somebody doesnt get on the ballot and they cant get on at the same time limit so that means they gave up you know im major state self plez why would you let them on the debate stage to waste everybodys time and theyre already at zero or one or two why would you allow him to be on the debate stage is saw unfair shake what are we doing and you dont have time to talk mister drop the war in the middle east in seconds sir what would you do and you know its funny on the debates and i dont have you seen this but i think almost or just about every single poll where they do the online polls after the bay drugs was an amazing guy buthelezi ever met trudge trudge hes an amazing guy but dredge time magazine slate every one of these groups and doing things online polls are like six or seven everyday ive won every single pole in every single debate and im really happy now ill tell you can become a big story so the other day i said i i dont want to bring in my ok so lets say they would have had a couple of million people watching the first debate right and it used to be that these debates nobody even wanted to the television on the road ahead i think they forced them down their throat you have to take the debate on what they can you license so the first debate was by fox and they had million people actually more than that after the final numbers but million people which was about the largest in the history of cable television right the next line was cnn within million people now think of this cnns coverage im pretty big events like lures and other things right in the history of cnn it was the highestrated show them and they made it three hours which i shouldnt i could stand up i could do this for hours they wouldnt matter but nobody wants to watch this stuff than three hours especially when ninety percent of the people i know theyre not doing the doing and i dont even know why theyre doing but nobody wants so that wasnt here and then we went to cnbc where john harwood what an idiot you know how bad its not even a person and i have to tell you for four weeks before that he was so nice to me wonderful you know mister drop your grade and then he comes out with a question here is it mister truck and you know it is going to start off the day but they wanted three hours because advertising sells the so much now that they make a fortune and i said im not gonna lie and everyone said these people never be able to stop him and i said yes i stopped i think it took they what do you think about three minutes im not going and i have to tell you carson said hell go along with it so that was very nice then carson had he said that i have to give credit where credit is due as ive been a little bit rough on him but i have to give credit when he came along and he said i would go along and just so i went and i said the two of us and they sold it like an umbrella it took minutes so now my big thing is they also get mexico to pay for the wall trying trying to build its going to be a great you know in china they built the great wall of china thousand miles long ok this is all right in our case we need really a thousand miles its miles but someones natural borders now job areas which are pretty good but you know what that use it right so what about a thousand miles and so were thousand this was two thousand years ago they didnt have trucks they did have tractors they did it the oldfashioned way right and they got it done and it is a big wall so what we have is to build a wall and were gonna stop people from coming into our country illegally and if people wanna come in legally we want them to come in that to go through the process had a people wanted to come in now when i first mentioned his all of the other candidates again we started with now down to fifty but they gonna start falling like flies you watch at some point to leave i mean we got this one guy hes terrible is the worst ive ever seen know the guy is the worst debater hes a professional politician he cant think properly hes terrible terrible we have again i told you so they do a poll and i mean im like how do you beat the senator in florida so in florida you have told you have a governor and you have a sitting senator who by the way it doesnt vote he is involved how would you like to be in sauna and you invested a young guy you invested him you take him too hard and thats a great position right united states hes in there for about seconds why why but how would you like to have a guy who just now youve put in a lot of time and effort but if a man says hes gonna be a senator and then he goes around campaigning and fundraising he was yesterday homeland security very important meeting in washington he chose to go to a fundraiser in california now i dont know that im gonna win for sure but i am killing them in florida and i think i have the ultimate sound find a guy first of all rubio is very very weak on illegal immigration and so you can when bush just to put an end to that energy but we dont need lowenergy people we cant afford them hilary is she doesnt have the strength she does that the stamina but shell do it and then wont show up like sleeps like this and and its actually not we should be laughing we should be crying because she is by far the frontrunner i mean this other guy who gave it up when he said no emails bernie bernie he gave it up i think he just had a hernia operation you know he was carrying around the tax code that he wants to make larger i actually just now he just had a hernia operation but hes got no chance he took hillary and he gave her the election and is getting the second largest crowds im out by the way my grades blow everyone away i wasnt i was in sarasota florida and what a great place and we have had a time limit is twelve oclock football games everything we had twelve thousand people and i dont i dont have it say how many people i let the government says now because we have an amazing secret service people have amazing people that work here i let them say because every time i say it if im off by three people who make like headlines and create people nobody nobody but when bernie sanders would have a group of five thousand people i get much bigger things than he does now in the meantime has been going down the tubes went to talk about it much anymore but the just hillary shouldnt be allowed to run because what she did is illegal i wanted to run i wanted to run and by the way the foxhole just came out i beat her easily in the box below you know i cant believe i had this whole thing and i never mentioned post and i could use and then everybody in the press and my opponents he always talks about polls you know why because im winning all of them if i would honestly think about it one of the major mainstream as me thats a long ago why do you always talk about balls and i didnt i never thought of a question i said i dont know because of winning im winning every poll its good to talk about him i dont know what the hell knows what they mean i think they mean something right it is not a strange you know the interview people and they say with certainty that your plus or minus an amazing thing i studied at wharton i guess it works but then when you have many many many her number one in every single line and number one in every single and number one i mean you look i number one new hampshire number one south carolina and big margin ya gotta really work hard to catch me in new hampshire let me tell you and the people and i hate people and then you go down south carolina tremendous every and then we go to nevada tremendous and in nevada i win the hispanic vote ok they do and ive always said im gonna win this because im gonna bring jobs back im bringing jobs back im bringing back from china and im bringing back from japan and im bringing back from mexico and im bringing back from vietnam every place we dont have jobs again were going to have jobs the number one and probably get it tonight so i can maybe just avoid this question but i guess i go around i see a lot of different places i use a lot of college auditorium saddam because the crowd sizes and a lot of students come up mr trump what can you do to help us which and the biggest thing their children with a den go two years or four years to college and theyre good good colleges and they cant get a job its one of the most heart wrenching questions again and you see this and theyre borrowing money from and to enlarge the federal government with the only thing its just about the only thing the federal government makes money with this should be making money with what were gonna do something with it and you know i dont know whats going on with the colleges but those colleges that going up like to skyrocket you know things are sort of even though it is going up at the college is so somebodys doing something wrong with it and one of the regions ecology is because the federal government pays for the students but the students can afford to pay that much and we gotta look a little bit into the college is why are they going up more than anything else they must be making a fortune lets buy a college or by acknowledged up i dont buy but but there is something going on but one of the saddest things is when you see these the worst is really good and i feel so badly for him but it gives me because im gonna create the jobs they cant get jobs and with it change that around when they go and they do a good job especially really hard to be good stewards and then they cant they come out they come out and they cant find anything they dont know what to do and then they own money to the federal government and everybody else and theyve done everything they can to get through college with you know we need to start winning in this country and within a start helping them out we gotta help them you know i always talk about the bets and everybody does have a great debt plan nobody treated worse than the mets illegal immigrants are treated better than events im telling treated better than our heads and thats gonna end within a treat our hats within a cheetah and i plan couple of weeks ago i was on a great great shape and we went it was an amazing day on the wisconsin and we put on the battleship is that looks like an author i love renovating you know i love buying a building the foundations of the structures there the outside is there have to replace windows sometimes if you can give them to keep him like im doing the old post office in washington way has one of the most beautiful buildings in washington was a disaster thirty years but it out to bid think of it in the obama administration dealmaker one of the most soughtafter properties in the history of the government services you know gsa and were now under budget and ahead of schedule think of that thats what you want in the country thats what you want then the country has got to be one of the best hotels anywhere in the world the trump international somebody said well we have to keep the name that government they were saying we have to keep the name but i will tell you and ive dealt with the gsa and theyre really terrific people that you really have some great people in government you really do if we can be led properly this country is going to go to a level that you wont even believe ive been saying over the last two months have met so many people like yourselves and its really similar this so much love in the room but ive met so many people and ive seen the genius of these people and ive been saying in my opinion i really think we have the potential to add greater than ever before i really believe that will make it great and will build it up and well make enrich again heres somebody a woman came up to me said mr truck crashed to say richard a debtor nation right now she said im voting for you i love you i love you but please dont say were gonna make enrichment to jump it stresses that i have to say were not going to cut medicare you know carson wants to cut medicare he wants to get rid of medicare c you know thats actually a program that works claim now you have waste fraud abuse in social security and medicare will take care of that problem with paying into your plans now that coming up to you its getting to be that time me i dont want to say ok were gonna needed and i think is unfair after all these years they want to cut you governor christie wants to wants to raise the age age so they have to wait another you know pretty extended period of time its not fair youve been used money back from all these countries that have been just absolutely so i said to the woman said you know what maybe chris but i have no choice but to be so rich and whether what were going to do i get talking about tremendous fun stuff again when a china when you have imbalances of billion two hundred and fifty million wouldnt be good right about billion a year a year and then they say i am a freetrader i believe in region but has to be true we can be stupid people right so trump is in a free trade hes not as terrible said no no im a freetrader years we have a trade imbalance with china over billion every year thats called dumb trade thats not that we have to pee and then the head of china comes and poor obama so since he greets him where the state in assets and he talks about our partner well i want to be a partner to i can be a partner were making and the guy and china he had been good looking guy strong as hell in a different system over there thats like one of these systems pounding each other and stuff as far as guy gets up to the top we dont do that over here thats a system that i dont have you know how it went from the time theyre in kindergarten the smartest toughest smartest that by the time they get up to that little point that guy hes so hes looking and talking about this wonderful relationship we had hes building islands military islands in the south china sea i dont think he got an environmental impact statement do you think they went out and said all we have to do our environmental impact said no they just thought about x commanders out there and they started digging that ocean and dropping thats and now and by the way i heard this the other day and i do still things ive been saying bob the oil and gas now i did want to go into iraq i should get credits the vision and a more militaristic than anybody other than him anybody in this room know this guy looks like this seriously but im more military said that anybody in this room but i want to build that military says trump what ive been saying dont go into iraq and it two thousand and three or four a delegation came from the white house cuz i get a lot of publicity for whatever then i do the apprentice that was a huge hit by the way they wanted to extend me they came in ahead of an incredible guy came to my office with executives from nbc and they wanted to run for president he said no no no we want to thank you nobody nobody would be season and i mean you know its been a great head and i said no and i just held my breath you know the famous escalator seeing i held my breath i said to my wife are you sure i want to be doing this and i said lets go and we went down that escalator had withstood the press the press i mean even now look look at tonight its its so many cameras the other a look at all those red lights every word everywhere everywhere but you know its an amazing things i said to my wife come on lets go and she waved and im waving and then i went up and talked about illegal immigration and little did i know i was hitting a nerve that was so incredible made that speech and i talk about whats happened to that you had jameel killed which uses a wonderful man you saw his father probably over the last couple of days until they just shot for no reason whatsoever shot and then you seek in san francisco shot by an illegal and you see all of the tremendous growth and all of a sudden people rush limbaugh said nobodys ever taken more in coming to drop this is gonna be like this i dont last for a year and a half i never heard that term with respect to the press said the pr incoming like that and then has a news conference in the doubles down and he said im right about somebody else its because i know how it works we ought to be slightly gotta be somebody else when i got up and other people have said id like to apologize for any way i can apologize to the people for them he cant do that when youre right but i said i myself at this level of intensity there is no way any human being can make it for a year but all of a sudden people so i was right and if i didnt bring that up and invited to take all of that unbelievable harsh and unfair punishment from the mainstream media ill tell you what we wouldnt be talking about illegal immigration we wouldnt be talking about the crime and dont kid yourself i dont mention that that often because im really good at this stuff but the jobs are being taken away from people that are in our country tremendous numbers of jobs so we need to change that whole system its gonna be changed remember this you know you have to get points revision when you elect somebody i think i have everybody in this room im pretty sure that everybody thinks ive been places and they say well there there because hes a great entertainer im not here to entertain folks im not an entertainer im not a lot of the you know i like the people in the room are there because he is a wonderful show in a wonderful entertainer and thats not the reason were here to please dont waste my time with the entertainment stuff im not an entertainer believe me im somebody that knows how to get things done im a guy thats won all my life whether its the apprentice or business or whether its the art of the deal what are the most incredible one of the biggest selling business books of all time i think the biggest but i want to say one of the kilda by saying the but i think it is the biggest selling business books we gotta win we can win together one of the things ive been saying right take you take do you think we should have been there iraq iran fighting fighting fighting they love to fight we want to rebuild our country right site we build a gas station did you see the gas station million dollars and then it didnt work ok ok i get every in this country we dont have any money if we want to build a school children we dont have any money if we want to fix up our roads and our bridges are falling down in china the building bridges all over the place ok so i said take the oil and keeping we should never been in iraq but take the l because if you dont weve spent two trillion dollars thousands of lives the wounded warriors and we give some of that oil to the families of the people that have lost their chance and we give money to wounded warriors are the most incredible of all people i deal with the time i deal with him and i see him and they had the biggest smile and they may be missing their legs they may be missing and are they may be worse than that and their their strength is i think to me the strongest of all ive never said they liked it but the problem is so we go into iraq at least two trillion thousands of lines wounded warriors got nothing nothing we dont have anything whatever happened to the victim belongs the spoils in the old days when we were smart and strong which were not anymore with stupid people will stop it was being led by stupid people and were stupid because we allow these people they get into office how does it happen and ill tell you the few people that are demonstrating that will end up getting a much bigger but thats ok but the few people if they were standing in most of those people become converted they agree with me they agree with because lets not do agree with what am i said im sayin common sense im saying a little business im saying a lot of heart because i want to take care of people that can you know theyre going to be people that cant afford anything you cant let them republicans you cant let them die in this he says he wants to help people they dont have any money but we have to let them die and its not so well be able to do it but well get great plans and everything else but if you think of it what am i doing im saying why i liberals or why are democrats opposed i dont think they are i really dont know theres some bad people into doesnt matter but i dont think they are very interesting lee one of the poll said more people if i win and hillary wins they say more people will come to the polls in the history of the country just like if you think of it just like the and the million people set the record they said and it just came out cnbc that is good and they say the people that come to vote for truck they also check it out and ill tell you the other thing yet gotta be tough on the border and some of the hispanic baby wont like it but they left me because and the one cent a year thank you aware that sign off here at icici great ideas does make america great again and you know the africanamerican vote so appalled came out recently came out recently truck gets of the african vote for republican thats and one of these commentators whos like devastated because republican would normally get five or six percent what do you think steve like five or six percent to have a poll that said i mean i dont think these past years ago to be standing up with too many other candidates you agree with that i dont think so i have a of the african americans want run and one of these commentators say hey by the way they hate them winning they have such a hard time with the polls have been the one just came out the quinnipiac poll right and im telling everybody and ill tell you crews and repeat in second place and they said tired and they said romeo and cruz at all what about me and i went up a lot i went up as much more high and im feeling like a lot and they talked about they did it while trump is winning the other people are doing very nicely so when driving the median nuts and theyre very design is a but seventy percent are really designed as whats going to happen is and what did happen so they mentioned the and one of these talking heads said you know if dropped gets of the africanamerican vote this election is over he wins and why wouldnt i think what has he done what does he think of this and then were gonna do russians obama obama african american hughes percent unemployment ride your guys our age they have an employment thats double and triple what are the people have what the hell is he done for the africanamericans hes done nothing hes done nothing i dont think he cares about him i think hes done nothing its all talk at all words with this guy hes an unbelievable divider i thought hed be a great cheerleader for the country thats one thing i thought i said hell unify the country and hes really divided the country and whether the unified the country and were gonna do amazing whether to set records with the africanamerican to come up here that was such an honor for me tonight such an honor net and we appreciate so all of the things that i said and just to finish before wages have questions if you were with me two weeks ago i was much different i was talking about china all the time and i was talking about trade and im telling you all the best deals and other companies are all leaving which drew and then moving to ireland and other places and we have two and a half trillion dollars off so we can bring it back to our tax laws are so big and by the way my tax plan im cutting middle income families taxes to the lowest level that theyve been in we have been destroying our middle class which built this country and cutting companies taxes and corporation taxes and small business taxes down to right now its the highest its ever been right now were number one tax nation anywhere in the world anywhere in the world and i bring it down to the im not exactly the lowest but it will soon i think we can maybe do that but im bringing down to one of the least tax business nations in the world so the middle class is gonna be takin care when were seriously code so you dont have to spend your money at h&r block and spent a lot of the money the jamaican doing is complicated and were gonna do some things that are going to be amazing and were going to have a dynamic economy and this country is going to be rockin and rollin and its gonna be something special this country is going to be something something so much more special its already special at the same but its gonna be much more special and is already great but i mean were talking about really great and remember this remember this we have a great country we have a wonderful country we love our country but its really at the tipping point its not going to be there for as much longer its not gonna be great much longer its a big big trouble were not going to let that happen ok so lets now take some questions come on give me some good ones come on dont you have a question these people did such a good job with my road they had so many files they had you know they had what we need like five thousand signages and you put in for a fivetime how many people you know its size because with the kind of people i deal with if they find mistakes so when you have fifteen or sixteen thousand and you need five they got to find a lot of his day i thank you very much so you have a question to ask you a mega statement you did such an amazing i need to let you know the citizens of virginia and all the hispanic community that i represent love you respect you and are going to vote and support you thank you very much so nice ok lets go have a question wherever you want go ahead ok a young man come on young guy why whats going to be made out okay thats a good question lift him up here bring him up so come on come on up here come on that might be the best question i guess hardened concrete and is gonna remain at every bar and ceo you know its so if thats what i do parking plank with a set plank and goes ninety feet long and how long feet if youre ninety feet up you dont want to come down you wanna come down very gently and they drive trucks over them and they take trucks with drugs and we get the drugs and they get the cash not going to be the trucks driving so its going to be made of concrete rebar rebar steel aggregate to set up a nice heavy foundations and one of the reasons the wall wasnt built a lot of people like the war but they couldnt figure out how to end this is hard to believe but true was i right about new jersey was i right you should write another one i took such heat and all of a sudden the last couple of days reports coming out i get hundreds of calls and now even some of the mainstream has been saying it so im very proud of the people would have taken that abused without saying im sorry there are said to him paula just im right theres a lot of hatred going on we need vigilance we need we need vigilance we cant let this happen they cant blow up our buildings they cant cut off our peoples heads peoples hands but they cant do it ok lets have a question thank you mr trump we love your tone on tone in when ross perot ran he said should lightning strike and i get elected the first hundred were not going to weigh days to start doing something were gonna do something they want what you gonna do they want perot who i havent known much i know his son hes a good guy he made a big mistake he quit then a week later whatever reason i met anyone who went back it was it was over but he was you know had a certain style and he you know i watched i studied very closely and number one its really better to run as a republican i will tell you that and i wanna run as a republican leading myself before would you ever run as an independent i just want to run and win as a republican with their clothes with this class will probably run against the woman who cant win her whole life has been corrupt its been corrupt just not going to win so in the first hundred days were gonna knock the hell out of obama can sign you know the great thing about executive orders i dont have to go back to congress i dont have to go back i just sit down and i will be on signing many maybe not hold maybe a couple of good ones i doubt it but were gonna be on signing a lot of executive orders especially his order that basically lets anybody they want just pour into our country thats good im just gonna start immediately working on social security immediately working on medicare so that we really make it strong gonna bring were gonna bring great things back into this country you gonna be so proud of me hes got that shirt on you to be so proud of me thank you for the question i will be very happy ok ok well i love israel and israel as our our real strong supporter if you look at whats going on at and ill tell you that i will say it here very soon im going to his the meeting with bb netanyahu hes a great guy and i actually commercial during his election run i i made a commercial i said meaning i said nice things about him hes a good man hes worked very hard he has absolutely no support from president obama absolutely not so i will tell you i am very very very pro ok ok ok how about the young man and a green shirt young strong guy go ahead twenty years old wow did you have any problems or difficulties im very healthy healthy we have a lot of hats i dont want to mess around with them right right okay so i plan on the vets and people are loving it and as you know about three months ago on a wednesday they announced that in the history of the veterans administration which is very corrupt extremely corrupt and yes im great doctors in there by the way im gonna give the good the bad but you have administrators are a disgrace and the waiting times and the problems and people are waiting five days six days in a waiting room to get in and in the history of three months ago was the longest wait in the history of the va thats all sir and i put in a plan thats much more complex than this but basically we have doctors that are doing well because of obamacare we have a lot of people that arent too i have a friend whos a doctor is gonna be quitting these gonna be like you is going to retire out that the young age but hes gonna be retired and he said i have more accountants and have complicated its a horrible the paperwork is so terrible i dont feel like im a doctor anymore so we have doctors that have plenty of open time we have private and public hospitals all over the place that are doing well and when they left us veteran said his standing in line and dying by the way you saw the numbers people die waiting to see a doctor that dying hundreds if i couldnt believe it the numbers are incredible you know youd think but the numbers are incredible thousands of men and women waiting for a doctor may be a simple procedure may be a pill they end up dying so were not going to have to anymore that thats remember there are greatest people there are greatest people i wouldnt be here most of these people would be here so while its true its true its true so you not have that what do you do now what do you do ok one second so you ask hospitals across the street doctors right you gonna get out of there you can see the doctor say the hospital were gonna pay for the bill its much cheaper and everyones gonna be happy its so much cheap so with that he used that hospital thats looking for some business could be private could be public within two years doctors that are looking for business to pay the bill is gonna go quickly and believe it or not its going to be much much cheaper than what were doing right now and what were doing right now is insulting ok ok i had your designer i didnt think you were that you dont look like im so that americans americans love winners and thank you thank you thank you darling its own eyes china id like to see more made in american apparel get up get out get up so so nice what a nice question but you know what what she said is so important to remember the old days when some of us were young and some of us werent even born when talking about but we have a sick are made in the usa that meant wild ride out of it said made in japan it was like damn good it was it was terrible now if you dont have it anymore we had those stickers made in the usa and that meant super super quality i just wanna come on over believe me if i did like the question she was so nice gotta work to get up here ill tell you a secret service number one all of a sudden protection nobody can get a look at this my name is alert and i think he will definitely make a beautiful angry and i think guys the fashion world that and so im living overseas for a while but i would i love you wearing made in america and its a great question because honestly you dont see it anymore you dont see it anymore were gonna be so proud to have that sticker and lets remember that question thats a very important question statement made in the usa was so important and was such a sign of quality make that much anymore like it was high i go to los angeles recently i saw ships the biggest ships you have a scene with cars coming in from japan pouring out there we send them practically nothing its a onesided deal we cant have them and speaking of usa when was the last time you saw it chevrolet in the middle of tokyo ill bet you did have one right we make good cars would make great course and now especially with doing its gotta be fair ok lets have a good question about this guy over here with a good head here this guy ok this is a question i love you thank you this is a question for president which is here how are you going to deal with president ok cannot stand obama like a lot of people when i was a kid i recently i was on sixty minutes they interviewed potent separately they interviewed me got very high ratings i feel hes my stablemate alright and i said this couple of months ago when he started by our country has as we dont even know who were fighting we want to find a bad guy but we want to find a site for rebels and we dont even know now his side were fighting russia where fighting other countries namely end up in world was ruled out knows what happens right but as such but the rebels could be i says we have no idea general told me we have no idea what we want to give them and whats gonna happen lets say they take over syria tell we dont know whats good is gonna be turmoil weve gotta fight ices and id love that russia is dropping bombs all over eyes i love it i love ok i mean we have a president notified how about this two weeks ago fifty men and maybe when i dont know ran over to syria iraq i dont think even those with ago now i just have to talk what does he have to say why does he have to stand up and say were sending those people have a tard these are our finest these are our greatest soldiers right why why do we have to have to open is now ok now we just announced yet another small group over today or yesterday they just announced we are sending more so these guys gonna do it doing ok but the numbers dont even think its a good pr move frankly but were sending men over to fight the enemy is not stupid they are not and they are not contained they are looking for these men and women they are looking for what the hell does he have to say you know i used the word unpredictable we dont have any unpredictability has a more general macarthur he wouldnt talk general george patton first of all he wont even be that guy who use foul language but he was drunk you couldnt be a general general he was still crowd he was he was a genius but he couldnt be a general and i watch on television i dont want my generals on television i dont want the enemy watching one little word so i did a deal recently was interesting and it was a great success and they called up my opponent has he told a reporter mr trump was really tough but we have no unpredictability we have to get smart and were gonna get smart one of one of the things i have to say but wait one second though one of the things that youre gonna say when you leave this thing thats happening here and in time that really was important because together because we talked about this if romney could have inspired he failed he sailed cuz became couldnt have won the first time because it was such a mess but should have been an easy victory and obama was on about obama he was on letterman he was on leno whose all over the place ok well we dont think every night he was on every show and from the us if the people in this room who didnt have all of the other people but if they had the incentive to get up and go but they werent they werent but we have to remember then and i think hopefully i look at the biggest crowds and we have to remember that ok just something thats really not so i always liked him and i know i kno right and i like hillary i dont go to sleep i think about things like hillary goes to sleep and then you dont see her for five days and she wakes up and she comes another vet and elton john and i love them lol general you always want to finish with him and when they do the eye and then they say they gotta do once the problem i have is my pastor wants how can i turn will you do me a favor passed away you make it a nice question so i dont leave here in a loan yeah yeah yeah address this issue either last night no matter more people with black on black crime right tremendous problem in philadelphia over was shot dead by black people yeah thats my question so true so true my question is will you dress the black community well what were going to do the crime in the black community and crime in our schools i would i went to the philadelphia well he is a highly respected great man in philadelphia and the answer is yes yes i love him ladies and gentlemen i want to thank you you are spectacular people doing the easy getting this much loved in this room we are going to make america great again better than ever before i love you i love you thank youwe had a hotel and were gonna have about or people and the hotel was great they called they said somethings happening here we can hold this is crazy whats going on and then we went to the convention center and they can have people and were all set and were excited and the next day they said too many people we can put them in so we came here today if you notice we have a stock market that doing so well we have a country not doing so well weve been saying it for a long time we have politicians other than the few politicians that are with us and i will exclude them but we have politicians it dont have a clue theyre all talk and no action whats happening to this countrys disgrace running for president i brought up i brought up the subject of illegal immigration i took a lot of heat that i can tell you rush limbaugh sorry said incoming he got more incoming that anybody out there to see and two weeks later everybody was apologizing to me they saw that i was right between what happened in san francisco to do incredible kate and her family is such an incredible family and jeremy lin so many people have been so badly hurt the other day in california last week a woman sixtysix years older veteran was killed raped sodomized tortured and killed by an illegal immigrant we have to do it we have to do something we have to do the weather is it is dicey that ok but who cares if it rains right take off my how do not approve once and for all that is mine ok so so were gonna talk about a lot of different subjects in and you know its nice friday night like that right watch that much better thats what we have here i mean the people that got the right people so well start with the little talk on the illegal immigration whats going on got to stop it were going to build a wall and its going to be you know its amazing the politicians years ago fifteen years ago they all wanted a wall but it never went it never happened because somebody didnt wanna probably a lobbyist you know all these guys like bush and like hillary clinton theyre all taken care of i dont know you know hillary has sixty million dollars and win jeb bush when jeff bush is totally in favor of common core week on immigration like every week on immigration want to let people come in although now hes using anchor baby you know he put out a memo you cannot use a baby now because i used it hes using it politicians but when they have in his case a hundred and fourteen million dollars in hillarys case shes got sixty no i dont know that shes gonna make it to the gate what do you think you know general petraeus over less and nothing seems to be happening so it will be very interesting to see what happens ultimately we have right now and i just got these numbers today what are the seven percent of all of the country are illegal and they supposed to turn out to be right the th amendment i just got an amazing we start a website as a bonus while im a nonpolitician the other day serb jury duty we used to put those politician but i will say this we have a great politician here we have them here really hope that hes the one person i saw his counsel because hes been so spoton hes so highly respected has anybody ever heard of senator just social people these people want somebody in the presidency stands up for them and the laws and traditions of this country we welcome you here you put into the immigration issue im really impressed with your plan and no one will make a difference agree with that fragile life so i go around and i see so many people have been treated so well by the people and you know were leading in every poll obama florida and you know its really a great place but florida we have a governor and we have a sitting senator and im killing them obviously theyre not doing a very good job that shouldnt be happening pennsylvania new hampshire south carolina north carolina taxes necessarily where were just absolutely way ahead of everybody else in fact you know if this were another country we could maybe call for an election right i would like to have the election tomorrow i dont wanna way so i think we see this receptivity is that i know the game better than anybody ive been on the other side you know i was totally establishment millions of dollars all the time do these characters right i was i was like the fairhaired boy do i look fair but i know the game understand it and so many people have come up lobbyist i said i dont want money from lobbyists but recently lastly your money i dont want your money because i dont think about it might take his money but in the end i school and dont do anything for a great business and i feel sort of stupid i say i dont want your money please i promise i wont laura told them i said you know i dont want your money comes in two years when you come to see me about something im not doing it unless its good and less gonna make america great again right after we think and i think that because i think i should take a lot of money allowed to give it to charity these guys come up and im lucky you know everybody should have doubled in a run you know that right my wife actually said you know if the junos be pretty well as she also sees the reaction in for a long time whether its trump the art of the deal which obama and carry obviously did not read when they did this crazy deal with iran i love that book you know i said the other day and it sort of played pretty well that is my second help rov book always the art of the deal and thats the real one thats original thats when they use real paper said the other day so many people that carry around the art of the deal because politicians please please read the art of the deal when you negotiate with china and japan with mexico with vietnam and with saudi arabia and with everybody you know right now we have a problem where north koreas getting frisky right now recently i ordered four thousand television set id like to hear that america can you believe i was able to find that guy you know these hot hot as a pistol you know that theyre made in america and im gonna give you but believe me i havent forgotten about you but then made in america but the other day i see today its pretty hot on the news that are very dear friend is acting a little bit rambunctious again so i ordered four thousand television sets from south korea whether its for lg or any of the romanian south korea a fortune and the wonderful and the wonderful people can abort we dont do everybody the most television sets in this country almost like dont think so right now theyre mostly made other than sony which has lost his way too high but so i see that were sending ships and were getting our troops ready we have troops ready just in case bob was gonna fight with you to protect we get nothing what we get we get nothing saudi arabia and i get along great with my apartment from even spent million to million am i supposed to just like a man very much but you know saudi arabia one billion dollars a dead day before they all went down a little bit but thats a minor detail but they were so now they make it happen in a day thats something we get nothing and they wouldnt be there without protection even germany germanys a power who has a mercedesbenz anybody lot of people there are power we defend the whole world where we want to be nice somebody thats so stupid alright they said thats terrible to ask for money they said they said thats terrible how can you possibly ask for money to defend the country i mean tell me tell me now were sending our ships were sending our everything weve got and what does troops that we have right now on the border between north and south korea thats dangerous territory theyre in harms way theyre in harms way and we get nothing they take our trade we lose a fortune with a reporter with china we defend japan you know we have an agreement with japan where somebody attacks apparently we have to come to their rescue but if we can attack doesnt have to help us do you think thats a good year thats sort of like sergeant berga has anybody heard of such a traitor dont know the trader i called president i called president obama the president we get sergeant bergdahl a traitor who by the way six people that we know of six people were killed trying to get this guy back six people they went after him they wanted to get him back so we get sergeant bergdahl and they get five people that they desperately wanted for years that are right now back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us house do you know the reason we had clouds and no matter where i go the other night were in new hampshire we had some new hampshire was so incredible that television is gonna be live i should have a rest blues tonight is live on fox its like we like stocks and its always going to be at its live on msnbc but i said you wanted to just cover me like anybody else would they go the next day and every time i speak it has to be live its not busy day killers but its ok right we have to suffer weather but look the reason i have this really incredible enthusiasm and i really appreciate your especially with this weather and everything else but the reason i have it is because i do know what im doing and i dont say that a braggadocio is like you people are looking for somebody that knows what hes doing whatever it is you know i said it the other night my second favorite book of all time whats my first favorite book the body blow the bible as much as i love the art of the deal its not even close we take the bible all the way right i was saying so they said i wasnt gonna run and everyones gonna run its just having fun just a good time is brandon like i care of my brand this point gutless macys because i said about illegal immigration they dropped my brand and im supposed to be douglas plus i have too soon univision my poor miss universe people to beautiful beautiful women girls but beautiful women and i get drunk but i think of it you have these magnificent women that worked all their lives to be in the miss usa contest in the mission and two weeks before the contest nbc and univision because they thought my tone was a little bit strong i was right i mean in the case of unification of so i actually put it on the other day miss universe miss usa i put it on because it was only fair to the people and we had it under small network and it was fine but who do that well because they want to be so politically correct they actually called and they said i will get it back on soon will get it back on soon you know the case of a couple they said losses nice car was all over the world a friend of mine you know because i opened with a strong statement meaning illegal immigration with the problem so all of the one day with nascar losses i dont have a deal with nazca it turned out that i lost now as they did they went to the ballroom at trump the route can you believe that was my losses and by the way i kept their deposit and read that it to somebody else the ballroom go out the next day ties with trumpets all over the world yes i have friends call me from paris hes a great businessman all its too bad about what happened to inspect you know it was a golf outing and one of my courses are you believe this is my big deal and it was all over the world the press i dont know maybe they didnt get it maybe they dont get it i was very disappointed with macys is not a big deal but they heard the tickets in front of the store and they called pickets tickets i said look into ours will be gonna believe me the gulf reliance they wont come back but they said we sever ties i said i dont care service i dont wear ties were made in china it always trouble gutless people so the reason that were getting this receptivity which is like this all over the place is because they said they should have been assigned a big document which is a onepage document which basically youre giving your life away and i saw a great summer really i couldnt tell you the ones but you know what he says i know which one but they started coming but what happens is that this is probably not as rich as people actually one of the reasons i want to recommend one of my life and its so true so i have like about a hundred and two pages or pages of stuff and they have all these boxes over million over million and i and it was a nominal better and people realize it was a net worth in this is not bragging and im gonna tell you why over ten billion dollars thats good right very little debt very little and then come with psych i think its over four hundred million dollars a year is a good my son is here look at her legend lives on that it says your online income and its like you know very different things but basically over million a year anybody that would not want to make that much money in one year well with it comes responsibility but i will tell you this reason people like what im saying is because i want to put that energy whatever the hell kind of energy is i dont get screwed up its good if its genius if its whatever it is i know how to do things i know and im not gonna do i i wont care about you know what a great building on pennsylvania right opposite between as you know the white house and the old post office real estate business slogan always get the post office post office in washington d c and i got it from the obama administration now thats cool deal making one of the most soughtafter buildings in the history of the general services administration and i got it and you know what they did the right thing because were doing a great job and we had a great statement they want to make sure it gets done and itll be opening and heres a little story its now under budget and ahead of schedule do you have to hear that from from government and we just finished around a lot of great job and my son is here and it does anybody ever heard of it and im not gonna let him do any big deals but you know what my whole energy who cares doesnt mean anything my whole energy my whole be is going to be to make our country rich and to make our country great again thats what my home and thats my primary its a great up to two nite always had an aptitude for making money some people would say thats nice one person said mr trump thats regress the country rich in order to make our country great i have to get rich again were dead early do you agree with me so i percent i couldnt care less if i couldnt care less about any of our stuff my kids are really good very nice and i just wanna countries so great and thats whats going to happen and thats whats going on as an example give me a couple examples in alabama usa steal the closure essentially a pleasure and i said why what happened and i went around and i said anybody work there no i dont think so i hope not but big closure and one of the reasons that china is dumping so much steel into the united states and other company other countries also but china i love that sign look at that wow wow thats true the only probably breaking everybody thank you so so eine is dumping tremendous amount of steel into our country the government to subsidize its almost like they want us to just die and they have no respect for us and again you know the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings and they buy apartments and spent so much money am i gonna just like them i love them the problem is that i say it all the time their leaders are really small theyre really coming theyre really sure and we have done these right we have damaged we have done these people that dont have a clue i dont know you know some people say theyre bad people i dont think theyre bad people i think theyre incompetent people a lot of people that i dont think theyve been i think theyre incompetent so you look at china and what theyve done and you know last week and i said this and ive been saying for a long time youve been hearing last week they devalued the currents and having a lot of hard times because of what they do and when i hear devaluation of the chinese currency you know the word the sucking action thats cool thats something like a vacuum sucking action to things happen two things get sucked out of us our jobs and our money not think of it china product picture takes our place and we owe them one point four trillion dollars thats like a magic called the magic deck in reverse we owe them money in japan is back have obvious the new prime ministers you know ill be really i mean hes minutes and they doing this feature and caroline kennedy and shes very nice little while longer because he likes anybody that my daughter likes right anybody my daughter like we love you so so what happens during a feature and they should and with a very important position because we negotiate you know you need somebody killer or killers dumped you need somebody so they said how did you get the impression she said well this is a pretty close you can check it out well i dont know i wanted a job and had nothing to do so i went to the white house and i said good job thing for me to do and they should how would you like to be ambassador to japan and she should really this is and then they show the rest of the show was her being wined and dined by avi and all of these killers wined and dined shes being credited at dinner lunches and breakfasts to do anything they want so i have the smartest toughest mean is in many cases most horrible human beings and their killers negotiators some nice people very nice people but i will put martyrs smarter we have the best of the world we dont use them we used political hacks diplomat we as people that dont have any business ability we have people use people that have never done a job somebody saw my blame them up to the plate and you know like theres an example carl icahn did anyone ever hear hes an unbelievably brilliant stuff i called them i didnt wear them two nights ago im doing pretty well im leaving every poll you cant believe i said i get there i want you to oversee the negotiations with china china and japan do it ill do it remember when i said somebody has blood coming out of her eyes with a ride while he had blood coming out of he will do it is unbelievable unbelievable negotiator and i know what i know the best i know the worse i know the ones that are overrated i know the ones that youve never heard about or read about the better than all of them but calls one of the great cities very famous a very rich and he would love to do it gives him that he knows whats happening ripping us so they send their self over here and actually somebody the other day said china has done to the united states is the greatest single theft in the history of the world said weve rebuilt china weve rebuilt china so you know we have free trade the problem with free trade is when you have free trade very important you need competently thats the one problem with free trade i like free trade im a freetrader negotiators a great leaders we dont have that so were getting killed by everybody i use these three countries we dont make good use everybody is killing so we will have believable as the manufacturer drive to do business with china and what hes going hes a good man great product better than what they do they dont want him sending the stuff you know its impossible to do business i can get my brother finally get a product in there and they charge a massive tax which they call a terror because it sounds a little more sophisticated because its impossible to do business which bowling does this is which and they want all of their intel they want their copyrights every other ones were not bind lines and then ill building big factories in china dont blame china i respect them and our leaders to be so stupid and mexico is the same thing you know mexico the other day nabisco nabisco i love you realize im never eating again disco closes a plant they just announced a couple of days ago in chicago in the plant to mexico y have you heard my story my favorite stories youve heard the story with we wanted to get alright i mean thats a big ford great company building a billion dollar car factory in places all over the united states shipbuilding this massive factory in mexico so i wanted his grade school i was actually you know i went to this great place the wharton school of finance hardest gonna get it even then it was hard to get into the artist but i went to this great business school and i get business and i fully understand so theyre building a tornado in joplin closer brad is certainly going to rebuild atlantic reserve guard yourself as a result is that theres no tax is no not so much loving plants here that building this massive plant in mexico another plant also another big foreign car company there was a plant being built it was all set to get started theyre going to announce it in tennessee you read about a couple of months ago wall street journal all set to get started all of a sudden mexico took it away and now its not going to be built in terms of its gonna be built in mexico so sort is there a plan and heres what i did i said to myself i give myself the right position and i say lets assume that somebody else becomes president will not be horrible so lets assume somebody else becomes president lets assume a very low energy purchase very very low energy so low energy that every time you watch him you fall asleep so lets say jim bakers dozen not not first thing that happens in schools go to help people flow over the world but forgetting about that so lets say the jet doesnt want this plant built so they get a call him to head for president the next day or the next hour hes gonna get a call from the lobbyists and the special interests as donors we gave you idea one hundred and twenty million dollars we want that thing dont you cant do that our people ok its gotta get done the plant will get built now lets take something better question who would you rather have negotiating with china japan mexico water this report that came out last weeks hours leading in the polls and everybody says why dont i have a pollster but theyll go out every day i wake up you know they pay these guys like a month and they cant function because unless theyre going have invented with a pollster they can talk and i say why they are you the polls show when every day theres a new poll in like pages i dont have to get a pollster what theyll do i needed save you money but really very very expensive very well done really well done because i was leading by a lot of ways that they had leadership i was way ahead of everyone they had a very good people but the thing and i do very well at it military i am and so powerful power and so great that will never have to use it nobodys gonna mess with us mostly so i look at the various things to do with our country and by the way one of them to take care of the ball but they did a poll on like who is one of the most popular with thats i was the most popular person like me and i love them five years these senators and these other than jeff is congressman these people in washington including presidents have done things its gonna take care of our so they do this poem and in the poll i was a nice person they said was the nicest i was like im a nice person who cares woman came up to me she said im not sure that your nice enough to be president but this is not going to be an election based on a nice person its going to be based on a competent person i want on the economy i want on jobs i want leadership by massive numbers like i wanted all these categories why do we need election we dont need an election these are such important out of doors but i as an amazing experience because the time i announced almost the first week i was a rough week but the press by the way largely very dishonest i have to say this the political media i actually think that the political media is less popular than congress can you believe it and congress is almost congress has almost no rating and and in all fairness because with all those cameras theyre all live in the trying to shut off the camera right now but you know what theyre all alive and so many life campers but look at thank you this very dishonest but there is a certain group that are fantastic people and every once in a while i get an honest story and i love it i cherish those stories are not often but they care so that we we have you have to understand and they have theyre really pretty much dont forget when i first read i said you know its amazing went to a great school family we believe in the gene thing you know i do like they used to say secretary of course is actually secretary wasnt one of the best of you but interior that but then i went out and made a tremendous couple to tremendous fortune and big company i did the art of the deal and many books are bestsellers part of the deal was one of the biggestselling maybe the biggest selling business books of all time i did the apprentice we love the apprentice remember bc hates me because they renewed the apprentice and i said excuse me im not doing it im running for president gonna make the country great again they are toy actually came up to my office the top people great people from nbc and they said please please run run and i said im not running im most of the advertising said im gonna run and im going to make our country great you are so so i look at the landscape i look at where were going look at where weve been weve had a horrible number of years number of years we can realize i watch the general the other day on television was just retiring which is of course i do you think will go against isis i dont know its going to be very tough can you believe this general george patton general douglas macarthur are spinning in their graves as you listen to spinning in their graves jobs are hard and i look at whats going on with the landscape and then i get to meet all of the people that i met over the last period of time and i want to tell you its been its been amazing its been really and i want to finish up with a couple of little points one of them is all i love is so when i get the call i say no no no built in the united states gonna say no we dont want to do i say let me tell you sir you gonna build in the united states and i will be called by people but i will not have any of them money so i dont care and then to say and ill call them and ill say listen heres the story building billion dollars in mexico charge you a tremendous little tax person and that is going to be for every car in a report and every drop it comes into the united states and heres whats going to happen whats going to happen is she was sitting there going to come back to me the following day i would say the following afternoon lets say i say by the time the day i dont like underneath this one is too easy and theyre gonna come back and they gonna say mister president gonna get caught by the lobbyists are going to get this done who say no interest within hours they will say mister president what you doing to us this terrible we will build the united states we will build the plant it doesnt help us it doesnt help us when you look at whats going on when you look at whats going on were in the business closing in so many places are closing when you look at the kind of money that these countries are making and im naming a few i mean so many countries we dont have anything well were running on fumes were running on you know theres nothing here when you look at what happens this so much sharper this so much smarter and were not we need to have our borders we need to make great deals you know the man in the back just how would you like to be israel right now they rely on us sanity theyre great people and we have a deal that is so incompetent so bad think of the deal we make a deal our chief negotiator goes into a bicycle race at years old he breaks his leg that was the good part of our deal that was the only thing that happened and i told people last week told us last week i swear to you i will never ever ride a bicycle at least in a race but we have a new thing that just came up yesterday of the deal we know all about the day period right but the day parent doesnt start that clark doesnt start ticking for a long time for a long time so that could be forever so theyre doing something believe me by the time we get there first of all why arent they giving us back up business and second can you believe this can you believe it im second double the other day it was determined that very important section maybe the most important right is going to do their own policing they are going to tell us we swear were not building anything its its sad its so sad obamacare we are going to repeal and replace it we we are going to come up with a plan and there are so many different ways you know you dont know this because you dont think about it this way you know the biggest beneficiaries of obamacare on the insurance company remember i told you special interests and lobbyists the insurance companies love it we can have such great plan it would get rid of the artificial lines around everything i have a huge huge company i want to go should i like that one group they dont negotiate some of the people that own businesses know what im talking about the insurance companies are so protected theyre making a fortune gonna make it so competitive were gonna get rid of the artificial barriers and obamacare i mean you look at whats happening with your premiums i mean look at this look at whats happening just take a look at whats happening to the deductibles highest possible its impossible health care were gonna fix womens health issues were gonna fix you know my wife came up to me the other day and she said its really sad because people dont understand how you cherish woman i want i will protect women so important and i heard some of the other candidates japanese some of the others the other day saying were not gonna fun various womens health issues can you believe this i said thats the end of his election i dont think like that do much to agree on womens health issues a few hours later he came back and he said he misspoke ok but womens health issues so important where theyll end up taking our country we are going to make it so strong so powerful so loved by people again so you know the problems that we have and you dont see it tonight but you see it is a tremendous lack of sleep and i actually thought that president obama the one thing he was an experience he never produced the job lots of other things but i actually thought that he would be a great really great cheerleader for the country when he was elected i thought that was really turned out to be a great divider as opposed to a great game and you look at baltimore you look at ferguson you look at st louis last night over the last week you look at all the things that are happening were sitting on our couch theres no say theres no jobs anything we are going to take this country i am going to be the greatest jobs president that god ever created i will you are you know i oftentimes say the american dream is dead but im gonna make it bigger and stronger and more powerful than ever before and thats whats going to happen i am going to make this country bigger and stronger and better and you get a lot of your president and whether it turn this around so proud whole thing is make america great again we are going to make america better than its ever been and were gonna love doing it and were gonna have fun doing it and i just want to thank everybody does this has been really reallyyou very much everybody this is beautiful we just kept driving and driving and driving were pretty far up and i said thats a great group of people this is what its all about these are the people that build their country how large a debate last night is good right it was good we had a lot of fun we gave very high grades and that even people that hate me gave me good marks is that amazing some of those pundits they hate me so much and it was so hard one of them said he won the debate i cant stand and i cant stand it they were they were almost crying you know one of the things that was interesting and he came across even more so on television last night was the room was loaded up i think they had like a thousand seats which is in a very big room thats far less than the people we have tonight today but they had a thousand and there was supposed to have the young people from the college and what happens is all the rich donors and special interests and the lobbyists got all the tickets right and i know so many among look at in the fashion these people there lot of money tremendous money by the way in that room last night but im look at these people those angry faces and they look at me how could you do this to us so i and you so when i complained i said all these people they giving bushs just wasting money hes just wasting and hes taking it why dont you just throw it out the window you should what they should do is give it to the vets that would be really nice but i got like bushs got a hundred and twenty eight million dollars have never seen it is at the bottom of the pack and just its just a total it so what situation well actually its a waste because all of those hands that hes got make a lot of money you know they make a lot of money so what do you what you do is look at is a roman i see specialinterest guys i see people that represent the insurance companies the oil companies the drug companies thats why we pay so much you know the drugs you know whats happening with the drugs health of medicare and other things with the largest purchaser in the world prescription drugs and other drugs to make people better and with the largest and yet we buy for practically the same price if you go to the local drugstore and take something off the counter you know people say you think you could find any waste in the country how about like you wont believe what were gonna buy this is just one thing out of many so if you go to the drug store and pick up a set that much difference in price because were not allowed for some reason i dont know what the reason is i dunno what the reason is but i dont know how they can sell it were not allowed to negotiate drug prices can you believe it so we buy drugs biggest in the world and we have about three hundred billion dollars more though as opposed to it we negotiated the price so theres three hundred billion on day one we saw that his a difference in the room last night you had representatives of drug companies they are giving money to numerous of these people like the head of johnson and johnson is jeb bushs top fundraiser well i mean tell me so let me ask you do you think jeb bushs going to make drug prices competitive when hes a good guy is what he johnson hes a friend of mine is a great guy but what did johnson is the head of jeb bushs fundraising so lets say jet one which is an impossibility but lets say but this applies to everybody else lets say jet johnson of johnson and johnson is the head of his palace it possible for jet in all fairness suggests to say what it was gonna go out and fight competitively billions and billions of dollars that they wont collect data collecting right now and profits and thats the way out countries working folks so what happened is i made the announcement last night that in the room you know what happened a lot of the kids there was like seven or eight hundred passes for kids and i blame the orange this i mean i think its terrible what happened last night i wanted tickets they said you have twenty tickets tickets im the one that brought all the action right am i the one i mean if these other guys came up it today that before people in the front row the owner of the building wasnt even meant for this he said this is the biggest crowd weve ever had so what happens is we thought it was a protest its a friend i love protesters gives the cameras follow they wont follow and accepted so its not possible that you know you look at it and you you see the kind of money you talking about but so i myself am putting up my own money thats a nice im way under budget you know right now im forty million eight closer than maybe fifty but im forty million dollars under budget that nice thank you im forty million dollars under budget and im number one in the polls are right a guy like jeff has spent a hundred and ten million dollars and hes down in the boone down here can you imagine that its just what the country we gotta get the guy i give the example of education in the world in the world were ranked number thirty but were number one and cost per pupil by lot number two is like so far down they dont even consider a number too so we we are by far the most expensive and yet we have what number thirty we have thirdworld countries that do better than as now you have sweden and norway and denmark and china in the top right but will number thirty and yet we spend more now wouldnt it be nice if you could take a look at what im doing here if we could spend less and be one or two or five or something you know now one of the reasons we do so badly as common core common cores a disaster coming quarters a complete disaster so we get rid of that and we start educating your children in new hampshire well locally i mean the people they hate coming quarter but then i hated because theyre bad people are haters and id haters theyre headed for a different reason its no good who wants to have a bureaucrat in washington taking care and educating your kids we dont want to do you want to have local education and id say that i watch it is beautiful the parents and they have two children and they have their boys and its so beautiful and then by the way their children graduated they say on the boards because they love to school because their children went there thats what you have to have it so important so we want to be at a point where we can spend less money and have a far stronger country and a better country i look at military expenditures you know im going to build the military bigger better stronger and i guarantee we can do it unless you know i hear stories like you know theyre ordering missiles that they dont want because of politics because of special interests because the company that makes the missiles as a contributor and the other company that makes the missiles that are good isnt so were ordering missiles that the generals dont want because of politics so is the beauty they come to me and they say we would like you to use such and such a company he helped your friends i dont give up my friends i have no friends as far as im concerned you know you know who my friends are you my friends so i think selffunding as a big deal im the only one that selffunding democrat republican everyone else is taking money from the bloodsuckers you know when these guys are really good when they give our candidates when they give ted five million dollars when they give marco demark did ted do well as how did you like my answer when they talked about waterboarding did people like that theres some people thought it was you know controversy ok so we have waterboarding some people considered less than chip much less than tortured and i said and they gave the engine and ted didnt like you know he wanted to stay away from it i didnt he said he didnt like the concept of the water but it wasnt that he went to stay away from it and my answer was this we are living in medieval times theres never been a time like this what i used to read medieval times they jump you head off and i havent heard that you know even in the wild west you get shot right to shoot you but they dont jump ahead off so now they chop you have james foley you look at whats going on and i said to myself what avoiding what it what is peanuts compared to what theyre doing and they said about waterboarding the question has died and i said look as far as im concerned what aborting immediately is ok and we can get much worse than waterboarding thats okay too and everybody was shocked and they all like in in life and in business you have to know thats right politically correct we dont want to be politically correct says the man with the red hat saying make america great again right but so important and and it wasnt just a question was coming up but i gave an answer that wasnt may be politically politically correct we dont have the time we dont have the strength we dont have anything to be its ok you want to be you want to be good you want to be good people but they are doing such a horrible thing you know when theyre willing to fly airplanes into the world trade center fly airplanes into the pentagon had an airplane into the white house where we had some very brave souls on that plane that ditched it before it got there right in pennsylvania right those people are great but when they have this kind of hatred in this kind of evil water body and i guarantee you this sitting back there saying can you imagine these stupid people talking about waterboarding like its the worst thing and theyre chopping off heads so when they gave me the question and the best response i got last night from all of these donors that you have to understand they werent might donors they would donors did these other guys and you could see pockets they went out cause theyre rich and they bought the tickets from the kids that were given the tickets to kids made a fortune last night the kids with scalping tickets last night and the people out there and i was told no no we gave them to the children of the college unless the child is years old and lives on park avenue cell i looked at that audience i said this is really tough because i have an audience where i am their worst nightmare because im not taking their money im richer than they are i dont need the money and thats what we need thats what we need so it was a very interesting people found that interesting last i heard about it i said thank you very much and we have fun they are paying for the first of all they are why wouldnt they they make a fortune off the united states they have not helped us at all with illegal immigration we have tremendous problems with illegal immigration new hampshire you know i have so many friends in the lab and you know before the political thing that we started months ago ive been up here many times great place great people up here and thats why thats why im asking via vote you guys better but i dont need your money you notice i said i dont need your money i need your vote right keep your money your money you know most guys are saying well you can give you will take anything you have given us an undershirt dunno i dont want anything i want one thing on tuesday you have to get out and vote ok because we have a movement going on that is unbelievable whats going on is on the cover of time magazine last week and they talked about this movement its believable whats happening and no matter where we go we get these grads and were gonna do great in south carolina waiting to grade in novato had degraded the sec which of the next the next events but we have something going on and and its a simple oakland it is make america great again were going to make america great again and we maybe have a chance of making america greater than its ever been before going to bring our jobs back you know you got stripped in new hampshire you get absolutely strip but one of the things i hear about new hampshire so much and its shocking hurdle for a long time now but but shocking because you drive through the beautiful wooded areas its a beautiful place its of one of the most beautiful places youll ever see and its a tremendous sure theres a love story and is a great spirit in new hampshire theres a great spirit but one of the problems and it just doesnt seem to go and thats why its so surprising to me and maybe it makes more of an impression that heroin problem the the drug problem and all of the stuff thats pouring in is is incredible i mean the drugs coming into new hampshire is just incredible and when im with when im with people when i you know when i i come out and im with groups of people talk about like lets talk about the military which they do talk about and they talk about the best we have al the owner was such a nice guys on him i said id like it if the might just work you know why i could say well thats all we can go folks and be nice to know were not going to pay the rent right were not going to give them to you know the country would pay the rent of adam i can work if the mic doesnt work for me i say sorry im not paying anything right now anyway but we have a long we have so many of the people from the feds but the thing that i hear more than anything else in terms of new hampshires problems is the drug problem and you just dont associated with sure but they have a tremendous problem its pouring across from largely from the southern border and were gonna put that one up and youre not going to have that problem we gotta take the people that are addicted and badly badly badly addicted and will work to get them better and then you know its interesting its interesting with a drug and alcohol and other addictions but if you dont start its really easy to sell ok its like drunken if you never smoked a cigarette you dont have a problem if you never start taking the drugs you have a problem and when we make it so hard for them to get into the country beyond even new hampshire because whether to have that wall that was gonna be so big and so strong and so powerful and were gonna have a border guards wigan have a border guard you know a couple of these politicians and im dealing with it politicians they said to me about two months ago they said you cant really build a wall donald can you build buildings in the ninety four stories tall walls you know i mean give me a break and and and itll be a nice long beautiful itll be a big wall a beautiful well they will get a name that trump someday maybe right so we have to make you know i dont want to but but it will be a powerful wall and i always talk about their right now they have these walls let it build ramps i never understood they build ramps going over these little walls you know we have also already little balls on the little baby walls and they build ramps and they have these trucks driving trucks driving right over the rams over the wall and down loaded up with drugs they drop the drugs off all over the country then they come back over the rap i said what are they just knocked down its a little while i never understood why did they buy the new why do they do the ramp i guess maybe they want to be nice to us that i wanna do any destruction right so we end up getting the drugs and they end up getting the money not gonna happen that way they more folks like it happened that way so when i say im gonna build a wall these politicians come up to me and theyre wellmeaning but that politicians they dont know anything that i mean honestly they know one thing how to get reelected thats what they know theyre good at that and the way they get reelected as all those guys in the audience last night take care of him and the drug company guys make sure that you never negotiate the price of drugs and the oil guys make sure that all good things happen with respect to oil right and all of these existing cause i was on the other side of the system for a long time and a very big dont know and i understand it but when you have the insurance companies you look at insurance health insurance the reason we have the lines you artificial lines around each state is because the health insurance companies to come the insurance companies want to have it that way because theyd rather have monopolies in each state that have hundreds of companies going all over the place bidding so that we can get up prices way way way down because obamacare is a disaster that is expensive and its no good and it doesnt work so the insurance companies say they were in the room i saw him last night i know these people the insurance companies say i want to take new york you take you take some other place you take iowa you take some of the place i want california personally californias very good but they have lines around the states ok and new hampshire as the same thing and for those of you that dont business is very hard to get many competitive bids so what the insurance companies as they say id rather have new hampshire and not have a lot of bidding then have the right to build all over the united states right one problem you can make the deal so hard for me to make deals i have thousands of employees so hard for me to make deals on health care because they cant get bids all right now once we get rid of the lines itll be easy why cant we get rid of the lines because the insurance companies give tremendous political contributions to the guys that i want to stage with so whether its insurance companies that the drug companies in the oil companies sold the same thing were never gonna get our country back if we keep doing this we never get to get it back i tell the story and to me its a great i could use any one of a hundred different places probably much more than that but were ford moves you know theyre building the big plant and the building in mexico and their clothes in a lot of plants are building a two and a half billion dollar automobile plant trucks automobiles and parts two and a half billion in mexico and i say how is that good how is that good for us new hampshire knows better than any other business to mexico ok i see these places now that our summer empty and summer converted the senior citizens summit converted to apartments but in the meantime you need jobs you dont necessarily need the apartments you need jobs and you take in the jobs out there giving him to other countries and we can end that were not going to let it continue to happen were not gonna have any jobs you look at manufacturing right now look at caterpillar tractors a great great company but if you look at what japan is doing with their currency the yen did dropping the hell out of there devaluing their currency to such a point that komatsu is not get the hell outta caterpillar we have to say you gonna do that we dont want your cars ok they wont believe it except the messages you gotta have the right message now you gotta have the right message you know see the problem is we have people that dont know the first thing about negotiation really business but common sense but its ago she asian these people are rank amateurs they are i dont want to say i wish i get in trouble see those be able see all those cameras back there theyve never driven so far to get to a location but you see all those cameras back there but its really true we have tremendous power because china is sucking ass try and without us china weve rebuilt china theyve taken our jobs are based thousands and millions of jobs by the way not douses millions and millions of jobs thousand and thousands of factories have closed cuz its china and it doesnt do us any good and by the way they sell their product they put it in no tax no nothing you try putting your product into china you can do it ok its really hard now boeing tried it and they made boeing build a whole new big airplane complex and they kept all of its intellectual property they wanted to stay wanted that and all of a sudden boeings gonna have this massive place in china and then i have to build a place here anymore so how does it help us its gonna be a whole different ball game so we have a lot of power over these over these countries now when japan takes there yet have a very strong leader very smart later one of the best leaders in a long time when japan i get along with them great you like me i like him but i just name is abby were not gonna be able to be able to rip us off anymore its ok dont worry about respect us more i have the biggest bank in the world is attended to one of my building since from china i sell millions in the tens of millions of dollars of apartments condominiums in manhattan to chinese people i love china i dont look theres nothing wrong i like china i like japan ok now what does that say i know thats okay thats not a protest thats a friend thats a friend had a very bad boy so for a friend right thats a very very hostile voice for a friend anyway so what we have to do what we have to do get them at the amazing thing you know people they lost the last people get a match security liz you know its its an amazing thing were talking about japan everybody ripping so were talking about health care military events but its all good i mean theres nothing bad i always say if i could take a person like that sitting in a room for minutes a doctor them i get some unless they got i dont want to say okay whos who said that raised yeah thats my man so anyway so we have the greatest business leaders in the world waited to take those trade deals were gonna rip up and was gonna read to them and they gonna be great what to do and we have all the power you know see obama doesnt think we have any power we r japan right now one point six trillion dollars we owe china trillion dollars its amazing they come in they take our jobs they take our money and we owe them money its like magic act in reverse no good for us good for them they take a job they take on monday they ruin our base we are gonna

anger and shes said essentially the donald trump is angry and this was her response to the presidents page and she said essentially donald trump is not known and shes been very nice and ive supported a little bit and and but she said it not nice and i was actually the previous debate the one that i didnt raise the six million dollar so thats where i was very happy with the one i didnt go to i actually that was my best performance i raised six million dollars or not the last one that i didnt do i think is my best performance because i got the vet nobody even knows about it but we got the vets the mets know about it and al knows about it i so where is el where the hell is out theres wears out how do i get up here this guy is so great he devotes his life to the vents and hes been so supportive of him i got a recognizable come on we love them know we love them i had the opportunity to meet you early about why a year murray in a tenyear legislature and one who said no sun no war then went to war supplies donald trump he goes to my event she goes to other peoples events and he wants to find out where its all coming from and he knows whos gonna take care of the vets and its not going to be the politicians they talk you know theyre all talk and no action so now were gonna build the military the same way were talking about with trade within a building military we gonna build it up but we gonna negotiate prices and when is the right companies and were going to get the right stuff we had the greatest ever created and its not going to be political anymore the money theyre spending on things they dont even one is ridiculous and then theyre sending it over debt allies that dont wanna fight and that bullet shot you know i always talk about humvees armorplated the best in the world now i love the wounded warriors if they had these they wouldnt be walking around or not walking around they wouldnt be in the condition theyre in they are theyre the most amazing people of all would you say you know they have been i see these people and their their legs are gone or their arms are gone or worse and they they have a better attitude then we have their unbelievable people but we send over the best armorplated humvees in the world and a bullet shot and we give them to our allies our allies we dont even know who the hell are allies are we dont even know who they are we giving them to people that are fighting governments with better of letting the damn government say that cuz these ppl worse than the governments spending billions and billions so we give them humvees they have no spirit to fight a shots fired in the air theyve run out of the hundreds dead gone and the enemy takes over what the hell are we doing ok what are we doing so if you remember i said take the oil right i was the first and you know its funny i said take the oil for four years ive been saying take the l now they take that take it though the bombing at the bombing and extremely gentle ii because theyre afraid that its going to corys an environmental hazard in there can you believe no can you believe this general george patton ever said we cant bomb the oil because it may have an impact on the carbon footprint you think george patton he would have slapped the hell of that environment let you know that that environmental is little walked up to him general you cannot bomb because residue will go into the atmosphere and it will affect their carbon footprint you know george patton oneanddone he would have slapped the hell out of that gas that would have been the end of that environmentalist by the way ive received so many environmental awards and im not gonna knock we need to clean air we need clean water we need beautiful beautiful clean water we need clean air and i get a check with the press not funny the president talks about the carbon footprint then he goes to hawaii and the seven fortyseven air force one thats very old with the old engines at spears carbon and everything else into the air and he goes to hawaii stays there i guess almost three weeks and then he comes back on this massive plane with massive engines and the very old and theyre not environmentally friendly to put it mildly and then he gets back into drugs about the carbon footprint give me a break stays there for three weeks a lot of golf he plays one doubts that the guys on the pga tour player so where did it let it build up im not sure but were gonna build it up with supervision where we get better than were getting down for no more money we can build it i dont even like to say less money but we can build up our military and will build it bigger better stronger than ever before and we wont spend anymore money its just like the drug situation white told you when we can negotiate the price you probably have that same stuff in the military people dont want to talk about it cause i want to keep it that way am i gonna make enemies with some of my old friends my old friends some of those guys i said there i i looked and then you wonder why they booed me when i had tacked poor poor poor jeb bush who brings out his mother because he needed help he needed help mommy please come walk into snow mom and i like his mother but i dont like that stuff we gotta do it on our own ok gotta do it so were gonna do that with a military and within a week to make this country so strong and will make those borders so strong and im telling you i was gonna tell you about the ford plant so heres what happens so ford opens as planned i wouldnt let it happen i wouldnt let it happen but lets say hillary can you believe it now i will say this i dont agree with bernice and his own much although i agree with them and do things trade on trade he said were being ripped off he just doesnt know how much i know how much bigger than even the difference is i could fix the trade and im going to make a lot of money with dread she cant do anything about he just doesnt being ripped off shes got half of it but he doesnt have that there but hes right with hillary because shes shes receiving a fortune from a lot of people theres no way shes going to tell afford to do anything because i know people that she cant do it she cant do it if you wanted to do so heres what happens so i say im not gonna im not gonna let that happen was not moving a lot of power and we want to use it and if hillary says it well im not gonna lie im not gonna let it happen and then the following hours you get a call from one of our donors are one of the lobbyists representing for that gave millions of dollars to hillary was one of the special interests or one of the shareholders that they know you have to let it a hundred percent now heres a difference they call me and theyre saying mister president is a wonderful day explained to me i was good closing up in michigan and other places plans to build in mexico please explain how its good and theyll say well thats good but we do want to build their shit thats ok you can build it but we are going to charge you a percent tax for every car every truck every part that you bring a closeup what we have to do it we have to do it and heres whats gonna happen standing there and im sorry we couldnt get you seats but theyre just too many people dont worry about it but there theyll say that this is a hundred percent like maybe theres a hundred percent theyll say mr president we have to build the plant we want to build the plant we have commitments about the plan i said thats ok you gonna be but they are going to sit back the following day and theyre gonna say could we persuade you say no then im gonna be called by people that i know im going to say no nobody gives me money i guess i know and then im gonna say do it or are they gonna say the father they got a call me back within hours and theyre going to say mister president weve decided to build the plant and the united states has happened as a hundred percent nabisco in chicago has a massive plant no more oreos theyre moving the plant to mexico no more areas its good thing we did all we could lose away no more areas but nabisco has a big plant in chicago they are moving the plant to mexico tennessee had a big deal for a mess of automobile company was going to build a big plant in tennessee was all set the deal is almost said it was going to be announced just before it got announced they decided they were going to move into mexico so you tell me why we should allow this to happen and while we should allow these cars and these trucks and these parts to pour into our country and no tax ok now im a free trader but you can only be a freetrader when something is fair i want fairness same thing with china china china said everything in here you know were still have still the leaders of stupid people running things chinas sense and billions and billions of product and our country not tax notice you try sending something into china you cant do it folks they call it a tariff i have a friend is a very rich guy their rent one more time theres no red one more time george if you pay their rent one more time with this can you fired george so i have a friend is a rich expensive item but he bought an airplane from the man in china who bought the aeroplane over here and he cant get it back to china because the taxes so massive almost as much as the price of the airplane that he was better off selling the plane so he sold the plane to my friend at a huge discount because he didnt want to pay the tremendous tariffs for a tax to get the plane back into china people dont know those stories people dont know those ok and their stories are all over the place all over the place a year ago have you been following what ive been saying almost ive been doing this deficit evidence can you imagine have been a politician for seven months so i can you believe this june sixteenth coming down the famous escalator a big decision because it takes guts believe me to run for president tax cuts you need a lot of gods and that we need a lot of energy and a lot of everything you need a lot but its going great and we love it and we love it and we love what we do with the ingame i love doing it adds that i love this i love the end game because we have something that we cherish that we love our country and were gonna do such great things whether you know were gonna do such great things but were coming down the escalator and if you were here that i was i was talking about in that general vicinity was talking about what japans doing and you see whats happening with caterpillar and i told you i have a friend whos a big excavator by big equipment always buys from caterpillar and he bought from and this was awhile now you see whats happened to caterpillar stock but he bought from camacho which is a big excavate a big company that makes tractors etcetera and japan i said what happened he said i love caterpillar but i cant help it have an obligation to my family my company my employees i bought from komatsu why because they have so devalue the yen that had no choice i had to do a double and i said really and he felt badly about it i said is the equipment does good he said no but its good its very good its that bad but i had no choice and i said the people you know if you own caterpillar and some of these companies with what these foreign countries are doing with their currencies especially china by the way which is the case jane king of the world of currency manipulation the king of the world theyll never allow our companies to compete with their companies ever and they do it based on currency manipulation thats why the dpp the trade agreement that theyre trying just sign is so bad chinas not in the agreement but the countries that are are theres nothing really talking about currency manipulation and thats the principle tool that these countries are using to kill us they killing us and were going to get it stopped and that agreement is a horrible agreement and by the way china is not in it now but its so beautifully set up there watching it this study it they have it they are good to go at some point into the back door theyll be in it and theyll take over that agreement and theyll make even more money than the making right now so im not upset with china im not upset with mexico or japan an their leaders are just too smart for the people running our country that people running our country dont have a clue they dont have a clue and i refuse to say this stupid see the woman just said theyre still open i said i refuse to say that im going to admonish you ok youre admonished remember when the man called out and said bad things about obama i was hit by the press or not admonishing him so now what ill do it so that my ok that wasnt a very serious admonishment was it like shes looking down that dont feel when i throwing you out if youre one of your one of our fans right so were not throwing you stand right there but people that are running our country and then you look at the granddaddy of all which i thought was the greatest but its not the greatest follows it so the un deal where we give them a hundred and fifty billion dollars we get nothing for nothing not even get i mean ultimately we got a prison sentence made a hundred and fifty billion has got to be the greatest ransom in history of you think about it right i just thought of this hundred and fifty billion dollars to the floor guys we get a hundred and fifty that should have never happened we should have gotten those persons back four years ago i three years ago we have a persons before we start the division they gonna say no were gonna say bye bye was gonna leave the negotiation now enjoy yourself and then you ratchet up all of the things that we do right you ratchet the hell out of it and you come back theyll get a call within one day or two days if theyre tough and they are theyre great negotiators and theyll say were gonna give you that i go a step further i say one of the reporters from cnn cnn dana commonly known as danna wednesday he said something i was very interested to trade down a badge shes a great great reporter great talent great onair talent but she said something she said you know youve been saying about your father my father said son take the lumps yet cause he said sometimes im to direct and i learned from my father because he was a great teacher i learned take the lumps out so now go back we have a presence back right now i go in to see our great negotiated is the iranians the persians persians a great negotiations now in the old days i would have said were not giving you the hundred and fifty billion dollars and theyll get angry will get angry everybodys angry and sometimes it takes a long time to recover from that so thats the old days but you get wise special and have asked my father that teaches you write so now i say differently as a gentleman we have a problem we r trillion dollars the republicans just approved a budget thats going to add another two trillion dollars it took them like less than a day to get this thing done its an embarrassment that they improved it the only one that benefits of the democrats they got everything they wanted funding the syrian refugees coming in funding other refugees coming in funding illegal immigrants they got everything they wanted right so now i see it differently i say we dont have the money sorry i want to give you the money so badly will have anything ok thats nice and saying were not giving it is now so they get angry but not nearly as angry because by the time i finished with them theyll feel sorry for us okay theyll say no no no and they live in a week later will call back it will make it will save a hundred and fifty billion ok i guarantee well save a hundred and will end up with an agreement this better than what we have now we never walk from that you think of it one of the things you have to do every mins walk how do you negotiated deal with their dancing in the streets all over and calling us stupid burning the flag this is before the deal got done this celebrating the deal saying how stupid we are saying its one of the greatest films ever made their dancing industry the population is even saying what a great deal buses right and we keep going into a moment if they said and dancing in the streets before i made a deal id say im good idea because it was embarrassing night we never once walked from the deal and i kept waiting for obama to walk from the deal meaning his his person secretary kerry wouldnt it be great hey how about if i represented the united states in city carry you know how good that deal with you now good that deal ok you know how good that deal that we got one of the great business people to negotiate that deal it would be like trumpet thats ok so here we have this deal thats a horror show hour day inspection period but that doesnt start the clock doesnt take india to a whole process all sorts of other problems like self inspection how about self inspection remember joe the you know obama calls him the supreme leader is at the supreme leader said im not calling them the supreme leader now my supreme leader the supreme leader said the following the sudden going on here i tell you something very strange but how about you call up and you say this is a self inspection area where they get on some very secret area where they probably thats why i magnin their deal so it goes up position we hear you may be making nuclear in this area and you have to inspect suspected call us back yes wed love to next day no problem is a president we are in doing so we just checked with self inspected where do these people come from where do our people come from and as bad as it is its worse ok so ive been saying is one of the great deals ive never seen greatest deal ive ever seen to get a hundred and fifty billion dollars we got nothing right ok but then i thought to myself wow its not thats peanuts what else are they getting theyre getting iraq theyve wanted a wreck for ever forever but we have a rack and they have a rand and they were always the same militarily and they fight and i told us all the time they fight and fight and fight they will tend to be here feet here somebody uses gas against explode they stopped fighting for a couple years then they go back and they fight the line never moves right they say it neutralized and i said in dont do it i didnt know about weapons of mass destruction which are not that they didnt have but one thing good about if you look if you take any any look bill leadership anything in iraq they used to kill terrorists right saddam hussein killed late today its harvard for terrorism you let me tell you go to iraq saddam hussein used to get great pleasure at of killing terrorists wouldnt have these problems like that so he would kill to have a mess so what is initially came up in my mind a couple reasons i talked about the rental cuz i cannot believe how big a deal it is its a great example of bad deal make it right and then i said what is the best deal is that theyre actually getting our act so iraq has the second largest oil reserves in early so i ran is now getting around to take it up just like you hear that take you to know now theyre getting yemen and they dont like him but they do like the border between saudi arabia mean im good at this stuff you know i talked about i talked about bin laden in my book that was written in before the world trade center came down and joe scarborough great guy morning joe they call them anybody know morning joe great guy he heard about it he got the bookies talked about osama bin laden two years before the world trade center came to because i saw this guy on television that is a reporter i watched i read some papers about them i say hes a bad guy you better do something i wrote about a month before being taken out he should have been taken out how did you manage to take him out and he didnt do it he had a chance to get him and he didnt do it bushera done it but he didnt do it and they didnt do it and the world trade center came tumbling down thousands of lives thousands and thousands worst attack in the history of the united states western pearl harbor because it was a civilian attacked not a military attack western pro so we have to go and we have to get smart you have a rand now theyre rich they dont have to build nuclear they can afford to buy it and you notice with spending all the money they just bought a hundred and eighteen airbus jets thats boeings competitor boeing is here airbus is over in europe didnt buy from boeing they bought from airbus so they brought in europe theyre buying missiles from russia there by all sorts of stuff from italy and other countries in by anything from us hundred and fifty billion theyve given us nothing we get nothing we get nothing and then on top of it after the deal is made they attack our wonderful sailors and they put a gun to the head they drop among their needs put your hands up and they have some rough guy with a rough voice essentially screaming at him right you heard humiliation now theyd still be there there be there forever except theyre smart they didnt get the hundred and fifty billion until two days after that and didnt want to say oh gee when i can get this morning so they let him go vicious vicious humiliation for us not gonna happen with us its not going to happen to us just remember that so so were gonna be jumping the border with it a deal with china very nicely but we have a lot of power and we have a lot of money that goes to them we dont have a lot of money because they suck it out but a lot of money goes to them we rebuilt china what happens is last night a missile off in north korea and nobody knows what it is this sort of saying its a satellite ok so theres a lot of threats being made by this guy we have soldiers on the line lot of threats lot of threats south korea makes a fortune every time i buy televisions thousands of televisions a year every time i by mybb i am from south korea will make televisions anymore in this country ok we should we dont make televisions anymore we used to make zenith and this will make him anymore rca so now you gotta buy them from the thousands their economic behemoth they pay as peanuts they pay his penis should pay they should pay at least break even at least something they should pay we protect germany we protect your paper we protect places you dont even know about i would become good at this stuff because im looking at it and you know when they say we have ten times the budget and anyone else you know why we do because we protect all these countries the nothing we put tech shoddy arabia think of it i know we protect saudi arabia saudi arabia before the ul game down now theyre making half saudi arabia before they all came down was making one billion dollars a day and we protect them we get peanuts and we leased land from military bases we pay rent okay its over its over its over its over so fiercely i dont have teleprompters i dont have a speech that im reading ladies and gentlemen is so nice to be with you new hampshire please vote for me if you dont vote for me ill never speak to you again all i want is you i will straighten it out its so easy theres so much that when you talk about some of the people that own businesses know really what im saying when you talk about and this is this is easier i mean the numbers are bigger but this is easier cuz you tell businesses you know you look for every penny he talking about trillions of dollars potentially but we gotta straighten it out and we have as an example our agreement with our trading with japan if japan is attack we have to attack and go to war and fight or rejection ok if were attacked the deals we have so were attacked japan doesnt have to help us if theyre attacked we have world war three this folks gotta make it fair and equitable ok all right cell so i just because its still hampshire and because you have that tremendous problem with drugs will get a stabbing you can have the drugs coming into destroying your children can have it anymore youre not going to have your kids are gonna look all over the place and then i can be able to find them to be when mommy and daddy go to florida and they want to get drugs theyre not gonna find not gonna be all over the streets and so cheap part of the problem is this stuff is so cheap thats the lure then i gotta find them theyre not gonna find them because we stop it up and we can do it we have great border patrol you know i started this where the border patrol called me and they said could you come to laredo texas i went to laredo texas thats the first time anybody so that the white house like that guys that the white make america great again right i went to lloyd i spent a day these incredible people these are people that want to do the job and theyre being told stanback stand back let two ppl flows row leave them alone dont touch anybody he saw the recent you know declaration if

america great again thank you thank you thank youyou know this all started we had a hotel and were gonna have about or people and the hotel was great they called they said somethings happening here we can hold this is crazy whats going on and then we went to the convention center they can have people and were all set and were excited and the next day they said too many people we can put them in so we came here today if you notice we have a stock market that doing so well we have a country not doing so well weve been saying it for a long time we have politicians other than the few politicians that are with us and i will exclude them but we have politicians it dont have a clue theyre all talk and no action whats happening to this country is disgraceful and you know what i had said i was running for president i brought up i brought up the subject of illegal immigration and i took a lot of heat that i can tell you rush limbaugh sorry said incoming he got more incoming than anybody ive ever see and two weeks later everybody was apologizing to me they saw that i was right between what happened in san francisco to do incredible kate and her family is such an incredible family and jimmy land so many people have been so badly hurt the other day in california last week a woman sixtysix years older veteran was killed raped sodomized tortured and killed by an illegal immigrant we have to do it we have to do something we have to do were going to talk with you have a lot of fun i you know the weathers it is dicey thats ok but who cares if it rains right range ill take off my how to improve ill prove once and for all that is mine ok so were gonna talk about a lot of different subjects in and you know its nice friday night but that right what that whats better that built this country thats what we have here i mean the people that built the country great people so well start with the little talk or on the illegal immigration whats going on gotta stop it were going to build a wall and its going to be you know its amazing the politicians years ago fifteen years ago they all wanted a wall but it never went it never happened because somebody didnt want to probably a lobbyist you know all these guys like bush and like hillary clinton theyre all taken care of i dont know you know hillary has sixty million dollars and when jeb bush when jeff bush was totally in favor of common core week on immigration live very weak on immigration wants to let people come in although now he is using anchor baby you know he put out a memo you cannot use a good baby now because i used it hes using it politicians but when they have in his case a hundred and fourteen million dollars in hillarys case shes got sixty no i dont know that shes gonna make it to the gate what do you think make it to the gate some bad things came out today you know those classified you know the word classified you know theyve destroyed general petraeus over less and nothing seems to be happening here so it will be very interesting to see what happens ultimately but we have right now and i i just got these numbers today i said what are the seven and a half percent of all of us in this country illegal goods can afford it and they supposed to stay in i turned out to be right the th amendment amendment i was right you can do something with it and you can do something fast you can do something fast babies a year three hundred thousand that you have to take care of we all have to take care of and you know in the case of other countries including mexico they dont do that doesnt work that way you know one day and all of a sudden we have another american citizen it doesnt work that way mexico doesnt do it other places dont do it very few places do it with the only place just about that stupid enough to do it i just decided to run i got an amazing receptor we have to set a zeppelin nonpolitician the other day served jury duty used to put down politician but i will say this we have a great politician here we have the men here really hope that hes the one person i saw his counsel because hes been so spoton hes so highly respected has anybody ever heard of senator jeff sessions unbelievable died somebody in the presence of stand up for them traditions of this country we welcome you here thank you for the work you put into the immigration issue im really impressed with your plan im know it will make a difference in this crowd shows a lot of people agree with that graduation help so i go around and i see so many people and ive been treated so well by the people and you know were leading in every poll with leading in just about every state including alabama florida and you know its really amazing i said well flood i love florida its a great place right but florida we have a governor and we have a sitting senator and im killing them obviously not doing a very good job is that shouldnt be happening but were waiting in pennsylvania iowa new hampshire south carolina north carolina texts usually where were just absolutely way ahead of everybody else in fact you know if this were another country we could maybe call for an expedited election right i would love to do that id like to have the election tomorrow i dont wanna way so the reason that i think we see this receptivity is that i know the game better than anybody ive been on the other side you know i was totally establishment was hand in millions of dollars all the time do these characters right i was i was like the fairhaired boy do i look fair haired black but i understand it so many people have come up lobbyist i said i dont want money from lobbyists but recently last week comes up i dont want your money because i dont know maybe ill rethinking everything ok how about this happen if i take his money but in the end i school and dont do anything i promise i wont do anything for told them i said you know i dont want your money comes in two years when you come to see me about something im not doing it unless its good and less gonna make america great again right right im gonna have to rethink and i think im gonna rethink that because i think i should take a lot of money allowed to give it to charity or so just take it so what happens is these guys come up and im lucky you know everybody said hes never gonna run ok you know that right and my wife actually said you know if you pretty well i just the reaction that for a long time whether its trump the art of the deal which obama and carry obviously did not read when they did this crazy deal with that but i love that book you know i said the other day and it sort of played pretty well that is my second overall via el perro via that is nice to me that book the art of the deal and thats the real one thats original thats when they use real paper right said the other day so many people to carry around the art of the deal because india politicians please please read the art of the deal when you negotiate with china and japan mexico and with vietnam and with saudi arabia and with everybody you know right now we have a problem where north koreas getting frisky right now recently i ordered four thousand television said id like to order it from here like the hudson made in america can you believe i was able to find the guy you know these had two hot as a pistol you know that and then made in america and im gonna give you book believe you havent forgotten about you but then made in america but the other day and now i see today its pretty hot on the news that are very dear friend from north career is acting a little bit rambunctious again so i ordered four thousand television sets from south korea whether its samsung or lg or any of them theyre all made in south korea i paid a fortune and a wonderful wonderful people we dont do everybody that makes television sets in this country almost like dont think so right so theyre mostly made other than sony which has lost his way prices are too high but mostly made in south korea soon lhc north korea is acting up so i see that were sending ships and were getting our troops ready we have troops and were getting ready just in case bob was gonna play with it to protect what we get arabian i get along great with all of our partners for me they spend forty million sixty million am i supposed to dislike them i like very much but you know saudi arabia makes one billion dollars a day to day before they all went down a little bit but thats okay these are minor details but lets say they were so now theyre making a half a billion today that we get nothing and they wouldnt be there without protection even germany germanys of power who has a mercedesbenz anybody lot of people there are power nothing we defend the whole world nice somebody said all thats like the mafia defense i said dont worry about it the month is not so stupid thats terrible to ask for money they said it should thats terrible how can you possibly ask for money to defend the country i mean tell me tell me so now were sending our ships were sending everything we gotta tell what does troops that we have right now on the border between north and south korea thats dangerous territory theyre in harms way theyre in harms way and we get nothing good competitor compete with us they take our trade will lose a fortune with them we would support you with china we defend japan you know we have an agreement with japan where somebody attacks japan we have to come to their rescue but if we can detect doesnt have to help us do you think thats a good deal thats not a mic sergeant bergdahl has anybody heard of such a traitor dont know the trader i called president obama the president we get sergeant pergola trader who by the way six people at least that we dont have six people were killed trying to get this guy back six people they went after him they wanted to get him back so we get sergeant bergdahl and they get five people that they desperately wanted two years right now back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us house stupid our way how stupid you know the reason we have crowds and no matter where i go the other night were in new hampshire we we had some new hampshire was so incredible to craig w every time i go on television is gonna be live i should have a rest police tonight is live on fox sports cnn and its going to be at its live on msnbc really incredible i really appreciate you especially with this weather in this heat everything else but the reason is because i do know and i dont say that a break and dishes like you people are looking for somebody that knows what hes doing whatever it is i was saying so they said i wasnt gonna run and everyone so hes never gonna run never gonna run hes just having fun just a good time is branded like i care brand this point this macys because i said about illegal immigration they drop my brendan im supposed to be regardless regardless i had too soon univision univision my poor miss univers people that beautiful beautiful women some girls are beautiful women and i get dropped by think of it you have these magnificent women that work all their life to be in the miss usa contest in the mission and two weeks before the contest nbc and univision drop because they thought my tone was a little bit strong and it turned out i was like good news i saw them both in the case of univision i see him for five hundred million dollars i want that money i want down so i actually put it on the other day the miss universe miss usa i put it on because it was only fair to the people and we had it on this small network and it was fine but because they want to be so politically correct they actually called and they said oh well get that going to get it back on soon you know the case of a couple they said losses nascar was all over the world in front of my clothes because i opened with a strong statement meaning illegal immigration problem so all of the one day was nazca from losses nascar it turned out it turned out that i lost nesco you know they did they rented a ballroom it dropped around can you believe that was my losses and by the way i kept their deposit and read it to somebody else the next day es seven skies with trumpets all over the world espn i have friends call me from paris hes a great businessman alex too bad about what happened to inspect you know it was a golf outing and one of my courses are you believe this is my big deal and it was all over the world in the press i dont know maybe they didnt get it maybe they dont get it i was very disappointed there with me sees you know certain does not a big deal but they heard theyre gonna be three pickets in front of the store and they called pickets were gonna tickets i said look into our gonna believe that go for lunch they wont come back dont worry about godless people and so the reason that were getting this receptivity which is like this all over the place is because this is a good sign the big document which is a onepage document which basically youre giving your life away and and then they cant believe the pundits you know they get paid a half a million dollars a year to sit there and make jokes are themselves right column funders some great summer really incompetent i will tell you the ones but you know what i think i can now you know you know she says i dont know which one to five left there were about but theyre starting to come in but what happens is that this is probably not as rich as i said actually one of the reasons i want to recommend billion dollars thats good right very little debt very little debt exactly as it has a line for income and income with psych i think its over four hundred million dollars a year good my son is here look at you can live on that it says your online income and its like you know there is a different things but basically over million a year is there anybody that would not want to make that much money and when you hear anybody really well with it comes responsibility but i will tell you this reason people like what im saying is because i want to put that energy whatever the hell kind of energy is i dont know if its screwed up its good if its whatever it is i know how to do things and im not gonna do i i wont care about you know were building a great building on pennsylvania avenue right opposite between as you know the white house and the old post office real estate business slogan always get the post office post office in washington d c and i got it from the obama administration can you believe thats cool deal making one of the most soughtafter buildings in the history of the general services administration and i got it and you know what they did the right thing because were doing a great job and we had a great statement they want to make sure it gets done and itll be opening and heres a little story its now under budget and ahead of schedule do you ever hear that from government and we just finished around a lot of great job and my son is here eric has anybody ever heard of the vodka has anybody let them run and im not gonna let him do any big deals but you know what i wont care about that company my whole energy shares my whole energy my whole being is going to be to make our country rich and to make our country great again and my primary its a great attitude ive always had an aptitude for making money some people would say that mr trump thats very kress you said your gonna make the country rich in order to make our country great i had to get rich again were debtor nation he agreed do you agree with me yes i cant see anybody with a sign that big ass to it so i will devote a thousand percent i couldnt care less about your post office i couldnt care less about any of our stuff my kids are really good very nicely and i just wanna make this country so and thats whats going to happen and thats whats gonna as an example a couple examples in alabama usa steel enclosure essentially a closure and i said why what happened and i went around and i said anybody work there no i dont think so i hope but big closure and one of the reasons that china is dumping so much steel into the united states and other company other countries also but china i love that sign look at that wow wow thats true except the only problem is youre breaking everybodys design is good thank you so saina is dumping tremendous amounts of steel into our country the government is subsidizing it its almost like they want us to just die and they have no respect for us and again like saudi arabia the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings they buy apartments they spend so much money am i gonna dislike them i love them the problem is that i say it all the time their leaders are really smart theyre really coming theyre really sharp and we have dummies right we have dummies we have done these people that dont have a clue i dont know you know some people say theyre bad people i dont think i think theyre incompetent people a lot of people think theyve been i dont think theyve been i think theyre in town so you look at china and what theyve done and you know last week and i said this and ive been saying bubble for a long time youve been hearing it last week they devalue their currencies and were having a lot of hard times because of what they do and when i hear devaluation of the chinese currency you know the word the sucking action thats cool to something like a vacuum to suck in action two things happen two things get sucked out of us our jobs and our money not think of it china shop product takes takes place manufactured for us and we owe them one point four trillion dollars thats like a magic act called the magic act in reverse we owe them money japan japan is that they have abused a new prime ministers you know is really smart i mean hes sixty minutes and they doing this feature and caroline kennedy and shes very nice you know why i like it because he likes anybody that my daughter likes like anybody my daughter like we love you so so what happens and they should have a very important position because we negotiate you know you need somebody killer dumped you need somebody so they said how did you get the impression she said well this is a pretty close you can check it out well i dont know i wanted a job and had nothing to do so i went to the white house and i said could have a job to do and they should how would you like to be ambassador to japan and she should really killers killers but i will put the meanest marcus smart it with the best in the world we dont use them we used political hacks diplomats we as people who dont have any business ability we have people use people that have never done a job somebody stole my blame them and as an example carl icahn did anyone ever hear hes an unbelievably brilliant tough business so cold i didnt wear them two nights ago i said you know carl im doing pretty well im leaving every poll believe it either and i said get there i want you to oversee the negotiations with china china and japan ill do it ill do it is like blood coming out of her eyes with hatred he had blood coming out of he will do it is unbelievable negotiate an unbelievable negotiator and i know what i know the best i know the worst i know the ones that are overrated i know the ones that youve never heard about or read about that are better than all of them but calls one of the great cities very famous a very rich and he would love to do it gives him that he knows whats happening so they send their stuff over here and actually somebody the other day said what china has done to the united states is the greatest single theft in the history of the world weve rebuilt china weve rebuilt china so you know we have free trade the problem with free trade is when you have free trade very important you need competent leaders thats the one problem with free trade i like free trade im free trade negotiators a great lives we dont have that were getting killed by everybody we dont make good use everybody is killing so we will have believable as a friend of mine is a manufacturer and hes trying to do business with china and what is going on is a good manufacturer makes great product better than what they do they dont want to just because you know its impossible to do business i can get my dumpling soup over here comes in by the ship and then now building big factories in china dont blame china i respect them angry them angry at our leaders to be so stupid thing you know mexico china the other day nabisco this glorious right cause i love the orioles im never eating again disco closes a plant they just announced couple of days ago in chicago and then moving the plant to mexico y have you heard my story my favorite stories for you heard the story with we want to hear it again or not alright thats a big great company building a billion dollar car factory in places all over the united states shipbuilding this massive factory in mexico so i went to this great school i was actually you know i went to this great place the wharton school of finance artist gonna get it even then it was hard to get into the artist but i went great business school and i get business i totally understand another plant plant being built to get started theyre going to announce it in tennessee you read about it and is a couple of months ago wall street journal all set to get started all of a sudden mexico took it away and now its time to be built in tennessee is going to be built in mexico so sort is building a plant and heres what i did i said to myself i give myself this does it really is sort of myself and i say lets assume that somebody else becomes president would be horrible somebody else becomes president lets assume a very low energy person very very low energy so low energy that every time you watch him you fall asleep hilary hilary rosen happens in like i said you schools go to hell people flow over there but forgetting about that so lets say the jet doesnt want us to win so they get a call him to head of ford president we want to build it well we dont want to be the next day or the next hour hes gonna get a call from the lobbyists and special interests in his donors and i gotta say hey jim we give you eight million dollars of your one hundred and twenty million that you raised we gave you we want that thing dont you cant do that our people ok a little bit its going to get done today the plant will get built now lets take slump is it ok that better cnn does this big report that came out last weeks hours leading in the polls and everybody says why dont i have a pollster what theyll do i need a poster every day i wake up is another bowl right they pay these guys like a month and they cant function because the list ago and havent visited with a pulsar they can talk and i say why do i need a pollster when every day theres a new poll and they give like pages i dont have to get a pollster what the hell do i needed save you money but its really very very expensive very well done only well done cause i was leading by a lot of ways it and they had leadership i was way ahead of everyone would be great at the people on it but the thing and i do very well at it military i am good guy build our military it will be so strong and so powerful and so great so great to use it nobodys gonna mess with us folks nobody nobodys gonna miss me country and by the way one of them are we gonna take care of its right another poll but they did a poll on like whos one of the most popular with it thats i was the most popular person like me and i love them because you know why thirtyfive years these senators and these other than jeff but hers is congressman these people in washington including presidents have done nothing for the vids and were gonna take care of our so they do this though and in the poll i almost everything other than they thought it was a nice person woman came up to me she said im not sure that your nice enough to be president i said you know what this is not going to be an election based on a nice person its going to be based on a competent person with higher i want the economy i want jobs i want leadership by massive numbers like i wanted all these categories why do we need it unless you dont need election these are such important categories but i had an amazing experience because the time i announced almost other than the first week it was a rough week but the press which is by the way largely very dishonest i have to say this the political media i actually think i actually think that the political media is less popular than congress can you believe it and congress is on those congress is almost no rating and internal affairs with all this camera live in the trying to shut off the camera right now but you know what their own lives and so many live cameras but look at thank you the medias very dishonest but there is a certain group that are fantastic people and every once in a while ill get an honest story and i love it like cherishes not often but they chairs but we we have you have to stay in and they have to really started treating me much better dont forget when i first read its amazing went to a great school my uncle was a professor at mit was a smart guy you know good guy right good family we believe in the gene thing i do like they used to say secretariat does it produce louis is actually secretary was it one of the best of you one other dude but interior thats but then i went out and made a tremendous tremendous fortune and great company i did the art of the deal and many books are bestsellers was one of the biggestselling maybe the biggest selling business books of all time i did the apprentice love the apprentice commander because they renewed the apprentice and i said excuse me im not doing it im running the country great again they actually actually came up to my office and the top people great people from nbc and they said please please run run and i said im not running advertising and im going to make our country do something were gonna do something so so i look at the landscape i look at where were going look at where weve been weve had a horrible number of years a horrible number of years we cant beat isis i watched a general the other day on television was just retiring which is why do you think will do against isis i dont know its going to be very tough can you believe this general george patton general douglas macarthur are spinning in their graves as you listen to their spinning in their graves and i look at whats going on with the landscape and then i i get to meet all of the people that ive met over the last time and i want to tell you its been its been amazing its been really and i want to finish up with a couple of little points one of them is i love is by the way i love the story because its so when i get the call i say in the united states gonna say no we dont want to let me tell you sir you gonna build in the united states and i will be called by people but i will not have any of them money so i dont care and theyre gonna say ill call them in and ill say listen heres the story building billion dollars in mexico charge you a tremendous little tax five percent is going to be for every car in every part of every truck that comes into the united states and heres whats going to happen heres whats going to happen you sure you standing or sitting there going to come back to me the following day i would say the following afternoon lets say its twelve i say by the time the day i dont need call i can only describe stories and theyre gonna come back and they gonna say mister president of the national get caught by the lobbyists are gonna get caught by this pressure and im just say no interest no it within hours they were gonna say mister president what you doing to a sister but we will build the union the united states we will build the plant and and all say the same thing to nabisco it doesnt help us it doesnt help us when you look at whats going on when you look at whats going on were in the business closing in so many places are closing when you look at the kind of money that these countries are making and im naming of steel i mean so many countries we dont have anything left were running on fumes were running on fumes theres nothing here when you look at what happens theres so much sharper this so much smarter and were not gonna have a country left we need to have our borders we need to make great deals you know the man in the back how would you like to be israel right now they relied on us sanity great people and we have a deal that is so incompetent so bad think of the deal we make a deal our chief negotiator goes into a bicycle race at years old he pulls you breaks his leg that was the good part of our deal that was the only thing that happened and i told people last week as i told this list i swear to you i will never ever ride a bicycle but we have a new thing that just came up yesterday in the deal we know all about the day period but the day period that doesnt start that clock does it start ticking for a long time for a long time so that can be forever so theyre doing something believe me by the time we get there but hes the alltime great why arent they giving us back up residues and second can you believe this did you believe it and second of all the other day it was determined that iran in a very important section maybe the most important right is going to do their own policing police they are going to police and they are going to tell us we swear were not building anything its its its so sad obamacare we are going to repeal and replace it we are going to come up with a plan and there are so many different ways you know you dont know this because you dont think obama is you know who the biggest beneficiaries of obamacare on the insurance companies insurance companies remember i told you special interests and lobbyists the insurance companies love it we can have such great plans it would get rid of the artist racial lines around every day i have a huge huge company and group they dont negotiate some of the people that own businesses know what im talking about the insurance companies are still protected theyre making a fortune gonna make it so competitive were gonna get rid of the artificial barriers great plan and obamacare i mean you look at whats happening with your premiums i mean look at this look at whats happening just take a look at whats happening to the deductibles this highest possible its impossible health care were gonna fix it womens health issues were gonna fix you know my wife came up to me the other day and she said its really sad because people dont understand how you cherish woman i want to protect women so important i heard some of the other candidates jeb and some of the other the day saying were not gonna fun various womens health issues can you believe this i said thats the end of his election win i dont think like that do much do we agree and he said womens health issues a few hours later he came back and he said he misspoke but womens health issues so important were going to end up taking our country we are going to make it so strong so powerful so loved by people again so love you no problems that we have but you see it is a tremendous lack of spirit and i actually thought that president obama the one thing he was inexperienced team ever produced the job lots of other things but i actually thought that he would be great really great cheerleader for the country when he was elected i thought that he would and hes really turned out to be a great divider as opposed to a great deal and baltimore you look at ferguson you look at st louis last night over the last week you look at all the things that are happening were sitting on patrick x is no say theres no jobs anything we are going to take this country i am going to be the greatest jobs president that god ever created i will tell you that i will you know i oftentimes say the american dream is dead but im gonna make it bigger and stronger and more powerful than ever before thats whats going to happen i am going to make this country bigger and stronger and better and youre gonna love it i love u president and were gonna turn this place around be so proud whole thing is make america great again we are going to make america better than its ever been and were gonna love doing it and were gonna have fun doing it and i just want to thank everybody just has been really really thank you thank you very muchevery night you know last night we were in baton rouge we broke the record held for many years by elton john my friend elton john for a five thousand outside tonight we have my guest much more than that we have thousands of people outside russia has happened niggas the record right there i just want to thank everybody you know what is this is a movement this is just a normal situation and i wish the press which other state but they dont do that you know that people they never ever do it last night we set a record and one of the reporters actually called and apologized because they refused to write the real number and actually called it appalling i wont say who because actually the person is not a bad person looking to people i meet you believe this one of the biggest crowds people started lining up seven hours ago see what they dont know is there may be the best i can see they may be the best in december wednesday way but they dont know maybe the best location but these people who are going to be famous your smile and have a good time me personally it was up to me now you waited what hours it was up to me it was up to me i think i might rather be there wanna be famous racism and thank you and it turned out that the financial jobs at bank of america and i putted it when i talk about it its a little embarrassing but its so good almost a hundred pages long ahead of schedule even these politicians have like one page and their days later i put it in and said i said youve got it do it on time on time and under budget right like the state and we put it in and they went back to look at the number this media back this is crazy because they wanted very little debt tremendous cash flow rate company and im not pregnant im saying that kind of thinking our country needs because we are in serious serious trouble and you know i say it alot our country doesnt win anymore and i have another way of saying i have another way out we dont use all the time but it doesnt sound as good our country doesnt win anymore we dont win we win with the military i system of the military because harris veterans commit suicide in one day and you believe who i think thats possible i said you mean a week you mean a month a year they cant get treated they cant get service they wait for four five six days in a waiting room can you imagine you go to a doctor doctors im streaming can you imagine you wait in a waiting room for four five six days and at the end of that you dont even get service a lot of times they leaving that going on vacation were going to take care of our best are great people willing to take care she came out last week the cover of time and incredible story written by somebody whos a real writer a really talented person in the media you dont say that often these this person and you know its amazing i never struck should do better and maybe i should never speak to these people it was the best and it talked about this phenomenon and it really is no matter where we go this is packed thousands and thousands of people outside we have screens set up from outside we have thousands of people outside youd rather be here right and virage she was barrages by thousands of people and they were angry because she was making it sound like anger is a bit and angry angry because were run incompetently by incompetent people people we have crowded schedule data beyond belief in new hampshire we were sending every record no matter where we go we said this is a record tonight you can see it because i feel the same you know a friend of mine is a very powerful businessmen and used people like this by the way with mexico and china and japan we have people that a political acts he said to me how the hell did you do that you watch the other night on television we had a place it was amazing to watch one of the most successful people he said thats nothing look at all the cameras back there two hundred and thirty reporters two hundred and thirty press he said how do you do it i said you know there was such an issue i swear this is true there is so much love in the room its easy there is nobody else has between and they go in and the bullets going in one direction and if a few people and i say sometimes i look at the audience that guy right there that right that beautiful woman right here but if we had guns strapped right onto the way believe me if we had a gun strapped onto the bullet going in the opposite way too different story however the military base a year ago we had five so great gun free zone right done job nobody better with guns and weapons and this man won all the awards the other foot rachel is wacko shoot guns of four hundred yards away gun free zone you know when you say the sick baby we get rid of my gun free zone problems because actually we have how much number one place and i say the united states is the largest purchase drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs but that doesnt have the right people so they have the region because without that and then you have with the evangelicals in the united find out you know yesterday we always talk about china and the president of china our trading partner a wonderful partner they take if they cant be the f play the fighter right you know about that did you hear about that you cant tell the difference you look at it the company plans and they did i guarantee you write down the most complicated mathematical solutions all done hundredpercent stolen off our web and day and thats right hilary but every time i go after what i dont understand when you see the night and then how could you do that how many why what is going on and why and then you look at the bottom you can possibly do that i mean thats like hours a day who can do that many thats like one little match so i dont know hilary is gonna get a chance to win by the way im beating her in the polls id love to run against wright also love to run against the communists i never thought today in our country when you think about it when a communist the real numbers come out shes really i watched them i say you mean we have this great country we have this so i watch i watch this great country and if that the best we can do thats pretty sad when you think of it so we love so i would around hundreds of acres right in the middle of miami right near the airport we had a big darrell tournament championship and its great nobody else has jobs with dead with related and a lot of places in my life going to know about it a lot of money i love this state i love this day but but ive created tremendous numbers of jobs down so drought market was bad thats when you like to buy right when the markets bit so i go in and we signed a contract everybody wanted everybody we go ahead and i signed a consistent way the country should help im saying because this is the way the country should be run so i go in and was very competitive everybody wanted to but i was the first one they had to sell it as a lot of problems and i bought it and i signed contract i signed contract for a hundred and seventy million dollars for which is very cheap but it had to be redone you know in the meantime you see what we did i spent a lot of money minute incredible the best so and a lot of people who work in a lot of good people a lot of hispanics are working there and by the way by the way by the way today i just settled with univision but a lot of this work for me ive been through a house in and a lot and we have a lot but the route so i signed contract right now i go in for a run into an interview with now ill do it ready to sign a contract and then i say no this just remember what we have to do with china mexico where everyones moving it to mexico i just heard carrier air conditioners moving in the business is moving in united everybody by the way how quiet house you know hes my friend but hes really a pain to keep quiet quiet quiet hes not a protester but mancini so theyre all moving into mexico y by drought we havent closed yet and i said to my daughter ivanka has anybody heard of it and i go through it was gonna make it but its really bad so i go back and i need all these guys from the wharton school from harvard and i said im not gonna pay im not doing too much money if i didnt promise that i wouldnt use bad language i would have used much stronger like it would have been more interesting than the places in lousy condition i dont like it im not pay tribute to frighten me they said no way ill give you a hundred they said no way hundred should know what to watch for me its fun its again for john kerry its work its labors is that the saddest but for me its just a fun whether i paid for a good price you got at the right time so i said if we go in we meet these geniuses i say you got to cut the price its not what you told us i did it its fiction its a terrible terrible shape you got it the way they should know what will make somebody else to break it they should in no way no way were gonna do it within about three minutes haitian how much would you take i said ill give you a hundred and ten they should we can do that we can get away after about four minutes we agreed to take twenty million off i paid for four minutes work as a twenty million dollars right now we have now you take dollars and it took forever two days later im elected president they would have been out we dont mean for us for our people getting those hostages back to say no when you leave within a couple of days palace hundred and fifty what does hostages landed about two seconds later tell us how you doing a hundred and fifty billion sorry we dont have the money we owe we dont have the money lets go two hundred and by the way this is in like maybe a hundred percent but we have people that dont know what theyre doing like john curry our secretary of state we have that dont know what the persians a great negotiators ok negotiated you look at what they did he never once we did every single point we have a day inspection they have with a selfrespect can you imagine a nuclear deal and we dont know what we call up with a complaint and they said will call you back tomorrow we will inspect the area they call you back tomorrow and they say the president everythings fine now you know the supreme leader we wont use the term supreme leader ok he says weve just spoken to the supreme leader probably because they want to kill you china two thousand years ago they didnt have caterpillar tractor by the way miles its a massive wall it does work you know the worlds work asked israels walls were believe how about europe some of the countries in europe that werent suckers to what happened with the migration like merkel of germany when she did to germany and they want to build walls around their own countries down because much going on in europe nobody knows where these people from and we all have a big heart i have a big heart you bill to allow millions of people to fill because their leaders are stupid leaders and you have to see the crime in germany now the crime in sweden so what happened with the beginning to rebound doesnt have the people the press illegal immigration and nobody from the media by the way but they have to leave he said the president not gonna happen were going down fast trash and its not gonna happen in the world and we have some three years we cant do it any longer well were not gonna be the stupid people anymore something happening we have we have you dont really mean were gonna build a wall to do absolutely build a wall gonna be real wall right now we have loved you say they build ramps i dont know what they just dont not go over the wall that bill ramps over the wall up and it probably is a severe penalty for not getting theyve been no we dont give severe penalties right now a severe penalty you know we have great border patrol i was in laredo texas and i was asked i was the guest of the border patrol they called and they said would love to see you great people and they want to protect and they can do it but theyre told to stand back let people come through it is so are within obama signs executive order let everyone weve lost control if we dont have a broader we dont have a country folks have a country so these guys nice guys some of them and they said he was gonna build it would simply you know fifteen years ago they wanted to build a wall they could build it because they couldnt get the environmental impact statement approved can you believe they have they have also want two things they couldnt get it environment can you believe this ive been saying the oil right over ive been saying for years and now finally it took paris and who is the first one to bomb the french can you believe that won the french the french but ive been saying for years and what happens they dont do it one of the reasons because the environment through can you believe why do you think general george patton would general douglas macarthur are great modern day general what do you think they would tell you right now yeah im the only one i said dont go into iraq im the most militaristic person in this room except for that guy right day probably be on the militaristic person in this room believe me were going to build on military so big so we are going to be nobodys gonna play with us nobodys gonna miss bestequipped i think i make it a struggle would never gonna have to use it i actually think we can do it but right i think its the cheapest thing we can do we have to check what he said at least four like many years but i actually think hes a are prepared and this is what we need with all these maniacs coming in when we want to take people from the migration line we have no idea who that we have absolutely no idea they have no paperwork there is absolutely no way we can never tell and ill tell you folks would not take it on and if we do take him from somebody else was sending back that we have no choice we have and we have to like they used to be done and the people of our country theyre incredible people and they really love the country and how could you get them because the cost of the law is peanuts i havent even figured out the cost the cost of the law is peanuts absolute peanuts compared to the kind of money that mexico is making off the united states and thats not including all of the drugs that are flowing right thats not a so these guys will never ever asked out if you talk about that mexico has lobbyists believe it or not everybody has a lobbyist every person that deals with the united states have lobbyists and special interest so when they come to me they should lift layoff mexico little bit you know they cant do that because nobody gave me money and i wouldnt do it and im working for one group of people and thats this group of people the head of his finance committee is a friend of mine is putting johnson hes from johnson and johnson woody johnson johnson and johnson has a hard time with the jet johnson is a good guy hes the head of his finest so then you wonder why is it that the politicians dont put out drugs to competitive bidding and then he wouldnt johnson died when he was governor we have what kind of cities do we havent welcome is right we have sanctuary cities in florida while he was right after he left florida went down i would see a florida went to hell and this is what we have but in doing so when you have what do you know you have other woody johnsons feeding other people in other industries taking care of all these people so when they go up and then they say some twentyfive years but i dont wanna we need the cover of time magazine that story was something special now weve all wasted a lot of time weve always had a lot of energy in my case ive wasted a lot of money if this doesnt happen i dont care about the money but the energy is incredible i think we have a really good chance you know when we won new hampshire when we won new hampshire there were questions like talked about the muslim we have a tremendous problem and i said we have to study it we have to see that has to be a bit nobodys gonna say that we have problems folks we have a problem we gotta find out radical islamic terrorism we have a president wont even use the term you cant solve a problem if youre afraid of it you cant solve a problem if youre not even mentioned were gonna make our country so strong gonna win again and again were gonna win but hes like have to do you have to go out and vote for wasting our time the movie so i wanted you people ive been all over and what i said to my friend is true i love you people get out and were gonna make america great again were gonna win were gonna bring our country back and were all gonna be proud once again thank youthe brady bill has kept two million guns from being sold into the wrong hands because of that background check despite its loopholes prohibited purchasers because they were felons fugitives doctors domestic abusers people with serious mental illness have been stopped from buying a gun so as bad as the gun carnage is i like to think that at least million prohibited purchasers werent part of that i also think its critically important to close those loopholes to close the gun show loophole and the online loophole you know back win the brady bill was passed in ninety for online purchases were not an issue we now know they are so we have to go for universal background checks and we have to close those two loopholes and i have said that if the congress doesnt cooperate i would use executive action to make sure that sellers are held accountable i also believe we should close what is now being called the charleston loophole under the background checks if someone applies to buy a gun seller has three days though sellers that are covered to conduct a background check and if it is not completed by the end of three days the purchaser purchaser gets to buy the gun anyway the reason its called the charleston loophole is that the killer of those nine people at bible study mother emmanuel church in charleston got his gun not because he was eligible because in fact it was learned shortly after he was not eligible he had a felony record but because of this loophole he was able to go back at the end of three days and by the gun he used to kill those nine innocent people and then finally we have to repeal the broad immunity that has been given to gun manufacturers and sellers in america and any responsibility for their sale of guns and ammunition for their manufacture of either just recently there was some small glimmer of hope when a jury in wisconsin found a seller of guns liable because of a straw purchase which the seller clearly knew to be a straw purchase a straw purchases are not eligible youre a felon you got a domestic abuse order against you youve been committed remember the shooter at virginia tech had been committed for outpatient treatment for mental health still got a gun but in this particular case in wisconsin the prohibited purchasers sent somebody else in with a clean record to buy the gun theres video and other evidence that the seller new the gun was for somebody else told anyway to the seller buys it turns it over to the real purchaser who goes out and shoots two police officers injuring both seriously and so when the police officers sued the gun seller the jury heard the evidence and came in with a verdict in favor of the police officers now were going to see whether or not that verdict stands up under this broad immunity that has been given to the gun industry theres really no other industry in america that has this kind of blanket permission to be reckless to be negligent to sell defective products even its just outrageous and we have to repeal that so that those who manufacture guns and sell them are held to some standard of accountability so im going to do everything i can in this campaign to not only talk about this issue and to give the platform to people like who can be much more eloquent than i ever can about why this is an important issue but im also appealing to responsible gun owners organized an alternative to the nra which is nothing but a lobby for the most absolutist positions that the gun manufacturers and sellers demand we have so many responsible gun owners im not against guns my dad taught me to shoot when i was a little girl ive even gone duck hunting in arkansas standing in the cold water at sunrise once was enough getting up that early to stand in a cold water i could tell you that much but this is not about kind of scare tactics that you will hear from the nra you know this is what they do they just scare responsible folks into thinking that you know the black helicopters going to land in the front yard and somebodys gonna show up and take your guns that is nonsense and it needs to be called out for what it is but the fight against the nra organization of gun owners im collecting names of people who are stepping up and writing you know about their feelings as people enjoy hunting enjoyed target shooting enjoy collecting but who are sick and tired of the violence people who are killed and injured so i am very grateful to my good friend your senator molly kelly and i am very grateful to clay for sharing what is a very painful personal story to try to save lives and i really look forward to working with a ground swell of people across our country who know we can do better than this we are better than this so with that let me throw this open to questions on whatever issues or concerns you might have we have some microphones i think so if people raise your hands will try to get to as many of you as possible i can see theres already a lot of hands up here lets see the woman in the back thats really close to the microphone right there have a question about the nsa so we have edwards noted we have trade run went into the spectrum and we have patriot on the other end of the spectrum and im wondering where you stand in that and why you stand that way and to let you know that i consider him very close to a patriot i think that the information that he released noting that the american people needed to know to have and how publicized so thats my question to you let me say this i firmly believe that he could have gone public and released the information about the collection of information on americans under whistleblower protection and he could have done it within the tradition in our country that shields people who come forth acting out of conscience to present information that they believe the public should have i do not know why in addition to releasing the information that youre referring to he felt compelled to steal a lot of information that by any definition had nothing to do with americans civil rights liberties and privacy but instead were about terrorists and what other nations to name to china and russia do to try to gather information about us and what our government tries to do to prevent that and to try to get information about them so if hed been a whistleblower and if he had confined himself to releasing information that i think did provoke the right kind of discussion in our country and has led to some changes which i approve of then i think people could across all spectrums say hey thank you for bringing this to our attention and thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond because he took valuable information and went first to china and then is now under the protection of vladimir putin i think that raises a lot of questions about everything else he did so i do not think he should escape having to return an answer for what he has done i think we need to continue the balance on civil liberties privacy and security its always a challenge and i would i do support what the congress passed the usa freedom act because i think it did have some some good changes and i think we have to remain vigilant but its always a balance its a balance its not just all onesided you know if you go too far toward security you do infringe upon the legitimate rights of americans and thats what were trying to end if you go too far toward privacy and civil liberties you can leave us vulnerable were trying to prevent that too so thats the kind of hard choice balancing act that i think president obama has been attempting to do and i support the changes that he has been making from the executive level and i support the new legislation that the congress passed get to you i promise but i kind of like to go in a broad sweep ok you will hear from you wheres wheres the microphone that we can get to just a minute i mean its great having people too eager after the region organ shootings would talk about gun control but he said gun control is not enough culture and gun safety and i think thats what were doing i agree with you on that and i like to refer to what im advocating is gun safety measures and in the gentleman makes a very good point you know so many of you im reading news online and i see a headline in the washington post which said something as i recall toddlers are killing more people with guns and i stopped what why because the people whose homes they live in mostly their parents sometimes their grandparents have loaded guns in their homes in their cars and children are curious and theyre picking up loaded guns and i read the story after i was shocked by the headline the toddler in the back seat where there was also a loaded gun picking it up and looking at it and shooting his grandmother and there was you know its its just beyond my comprehension and the gentleman is absolutely right if you are going to have a gun please please exercise common sense safety and keep those guns away from children toddlers young kids and teach a proper respect for guns one of the worst cases that ive read about it last two weeks was an eleven year old boy s to see the new puppy of the eightyearold girl who lived near him and a little girl for whatever reason said no no she didnt want him to see her puppy he went home he got his fathers loaded shotgun you went back any colder so all im asking i think is pretty common sense we need new legislation to close the loopholes to remove the immunity from liability to use technology to get instant background checks for real not just saying it but ultimately people have to exercise common sense in dealing with these weapons and keeping them away from children should be rule number one in my opinion so thank you thank you and the great teacher of your commitment to clean energy but i was wondering do you consider the extraction and use of shale gas to be clean energy and as president what kind of regulation would you like to see implemented for their fracking industry and use of gas thats a great question and its one i give the obama administration a lot of credit over the last two years in particular they have been yes lets give the obama administration lot of credit for energy and climate change and theyve been struggling with this and theyve begun to come out with recommended regulations like for example to control methane emissions i think you also have to have a very tough water standards and i think from talking to experts in the obama administration and the on the outside here is what they have convinced me up and this this is the following there are some places in our country where this extraction technique may be appropriate if we do more research and we figure out how to cut the methane emissions and keep the water clean there are lots of other places where it is not and part of what the federal government needs to start doing is drawing some lines and informing states and localities and we should also never preempt states and localities from saying no if a local government says no not here they should be able to do that the reason why i think the obama administration experts have taken this position is we have to go through a transition we have to move away from fossil fuels including gas but that gas can be a useful bridge especially as we move away from coal and we move away from dirty oil and some of the really bad alternatives and we want to keep more fossil fuels under the ocean and in the ground thats why im against arctic drilling and why im against offshore drilling because i dont think we should start trying to listen to people who i know care alot about the environment care alot about climate change and are trying to figure out what are the smart steps we can take so in some instances i can go along with it and lots of others i cant and we need to be moving as quickly as possible percent clean renewable energy we have a long way to go but that should be our goal and we should do nothing that interferes with or undermines our efforts to reach that goal as soon as it is possible thank you for taking my question it actually is a followup to that so southern new hampshire is actually fighting a fact gas pipeline right now which i believe that you know about one of our biggest problems is that its coming through new hampshire its not for us we dont need it its for export one of my concerns beyond all of the issues surrounding fracked gas is about federal energy regulatory commission which is funded by big oil and gas what will you do change first because right now weve had candidates come and tell us the local issue its not we have no control what can you do to help us you know i think very important point and i didnt really focus on this until ive been traveling around new hampshire and the concerns that residents have expressed about ferc really are legitimate because the process that ferc is employing does not give enough weight to public opinion in the locations where pipelines are going through it does not pay in my my opinion enough attention to all of the other issues whether they be health issues safety issues and the light and so i am going to do what i can to try to make it absolutely the case that forecast to in any of these decisions pay much more attention to local communities and listen to what your concerns are and do much more to evaluate whatever the consequences are the downsides of these decisions are because right now their mandate seems to be only about delivery of energy and anywhere anytime and i dont think thats adequate in todays world if were gonna have a if were gonna have a climate what thats not what it does not confuse the two issues when you say supported theyre not paid for by oil and gas they are certainly as a regulator for oil and gas used to paying attention to an oil and gas industry says i will absolutely give you that see my problem though now that people in the house and elsewhere raise this with me is that if were going to have a national commitment to do something about climate change needs to be part of that national commitment and thats my view on how we have to alter a lot of parents the federal government its not just the epa that needs to be focused on combating climate change every part of the federal government needs to be focused as i want to have a national goal and said look i wanna have by the end of my first term half a billion more solar panels installed in by the end of my second term enough clean renewable energy to power every home in america and if those are our goals its really important that we dont have the right hand doing something different than the left hand in the old saying so it would be my intention to legislative changes regulatory changes are necessary to undertake those but also to appoint people who will really be really focused on how everybody worked toward this big overarching national goal and not you know the kind of thing you know there was a time when we needed more energy people remember some of us are able to remember being in very long gas lines at least i remember those days and we were pretty much captive to middle east oil so we had a different mindset but now weve got to change that so i think your question is not only a specific one about a particular decision but it raises the larger issue about what were gonna do to change our our values our goals and thats what im gonna try to do the national student debt level is reached trillion dollars graduated from new hampshire college is going to be approximately in quite honestly id be surprised if i listed in this room with that little what are you gonna do best to help students graduate college we have student at your hands up comedy ever had student debt so its a pretty healthy majority thats a great question and and your statistics are right we have forty million people with student debt that now reaches trillion dollars so the first and most important thing is we need to make it possible for every person with student debt current and those who have graduated refinance that debt you know that to me is the number one everybody else can refinance their debt corporations can refinance their debt you can refinance your mortgage refinance your car payment why is it that students cant refinance their debt and the worst injustice to me is that weve had practically zero interest rates for seven years and yet i want to ask how many of you know that you are paying an interest rate of at least seven percent i mean we have people who are paying interest rates far beyond what the real interest rates are so i want everybody to be able to refinance and then i want to do much more to get both students and graduates into income contingency repayment plans and what is that this is what i had when i went to law school so did my husband you know we both borrowed money we worked with borrowed money in the loans we had when we graduated we both teachers we taught at the university of arkansas law school my first job was with the childrens defense fun and then with the university of arkansas so as i recall making like between and thousand dollars a year and we couldnt have paid some big fixed rate based on a high interest rate so we paid back as a percentage of our income on a monthly basis and as i recall it was like percent and it took years but it didnt it didnt have the burden that i now hear about from so many young people and their families because of the high fixed rates and the other thing id really like to do more of is to make sure that people who go into what our public service national service jobs get a lower rate get more forgiveness faster get a discount because they are doing something that scared theyre gonna do when your obligations and if youve been a responsible player and youve taken advantage of all the new opportunities that i want to provide there will be an endpoint and you can count on that so this is a big deal to me because too many people are being held back because of this debt and you say i think thats one of the highest averages in the country students in new hampshire are bearing so its a big problem for everybody but particularly students here and ive met a lot of them who because of their student debt they cant take jobs theyd like to take because they cant afford them i met a young woman who said she had the dream job of her life in boston but she couldnt afford to pay her student debt and live there so like so many young people day she still living with your parents and thats nice chance to kind of get out there make your own decisions about were gonna live and okay so youre from mount holyoke sister does that mean you want to ask about holyoke question i know i could see you writing and holding it up when i had to get really close to my question actually have to talk about empowering women and i was wondering if youre going to do anything about human trafficking and my second question was kinda goes along with college and everything else is how else are you going to empower the youth of america well with respect to your first question on human trafficking i feel passionately about this and have worked on this issue since my days as first lady in fact back in i worked with a coalition of outside activists and members of congress to pass the first ever united states legislation against human trafficking proud to say my husband signed it so that began and i stayed focused on there is senator and then as secretary of state worked really hard to do more about human trafficking around the world and still here at home we appointed a firstrate federal prosecutor who had prosecuted some of the human trafficking cases in the united states to head the office in the state department to take on these issues and we also pressured through the human trafficking annual study different countries to have to change their laws to enforce their laws when i as first lady talked with representatives of other countries they really didnt understand why the united states was making a big deal out of this because it was part of in their view of the culture and now they know that theyre gonna be graded every year by the united states government and that if they are having a failing grade several years in a row they can lose aid and other benefits from the united states government and its our tool to try to get laws passed to change enforcement actually to go after human trafficking remains one of the biggest sources of criminal activity and profits in the world sometimes we think of only one or two kinds of human trafficking you know the refugees flooding into europe are in many respects a form of human trafficking theyre picked up by smugglers who often abandon them the children and and adults who come across our southern border are often treated the same way they are their families pay money to smugglers and traffickers who again may abandon the may have been to them in the desert may have handed them to their fates on the long journey that they are taking we have a lot of trafficking of people into really exploitative labor situations literally people being kidnapped and put on fishing boats being ashamed to sewing machines in factories and then of course we have sex trafficking where young women in particular but even children are preyed upon and where poor families are convinced to essentially sell their daughters i remember being in northern thailand when i was first lady and it was before we passed our trafficking statue and part of the reason i was there was to talk with the government to convince them to take this seriously and i went to a hospice for young women who were the victims of aids after having been trafficked into the brothels in bangkok and then when they were ill thrown literally on the street some of them would make their way back to their homes their families whod been paid for them would reject them and i remember standing by the wheel chair of dying year old girl and having the aid workers who were taking care of her tell me her story and then the aid workers says you can tell the families that have sold their daughter hours by driving around these villages the houses with satellites have sold their daughters and so this is such a key part of discrimination against women and girls a rejection of their importance their human dignity their rights that it is a deep challenge to change attitudes in many parts of the world about the value of girls and to make the case that educating a girl over the long run will be far better for the family than selling her at the age of eleven or twelve to be either an indentured servant or a sex worker so this is an area that is particularly a concern of mine because it goes hand in hand with the exploitation of poor people marginalized people and particularly girls and women in many places across the country thank you handguns recently australia managed to get away you take away the thousand million handguns and in one year if we cant why cant lee you know australias a good example candidates a good example the uk is a good example why because each of them had mass killings australia had a huge mass killing about twenty five twenty twentyfive years ago candidate did as well so did the uk and offering to buy back those guns they were able to you know curtail the supply and to set a different standard for gun purchases in the future communities have done that in our countrys several communities have done gun buyback programs but i think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that could be arranged remember i know after the terrible await financial crisis and in one of the programs that president obama was able to get in place was cash for clunkers that you know getting off the road and it was partly a way to get people to buy new cars we wanted economic activity and it was partly a way to get old models that were polluting too much sort of off the road so i think thats worth considering i i dont know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work but certainly the australian example is worth looking at thank you for raising that and so i was wondering what your thoughts are on education reform and what you plan on doing for education reform once you become president well im glad youre gonna be a teacher thank you reputation for turning out educators and i want to really try to be more focused first of all i think we have to do more to actually pay attention to what educators tell us about what will work in the classroom and that sounds youre probably wondering why would you say something so obvious because weve been having a very vigorous debate a contentious debate over what will work and what wont work to try to increase educational achievement among our young people and i think the debate has gotten off base i think its too much about the latest fads the latest products the latest models instead of taking a deep breath and actually talking to experts who have done an enormous amount of research about what really works i want to get back to looking at what really works and i know that there are a lot of wellmeaning people who are really down on the public schools and i just dont believe her share that i think the public schools are one of the bedrock institutions of our democracy and therefore to make the mark and so here are a couple of observations because this is a much longer conversation and i must say i am i am honored to have the support of the teachers of new hampshire and america and my campaign and because of that i wanna be a partner in figuring out what are the best ways forward to do a better job helping kids particularly poor kids particularly kids with special needs particularly kids who come into school from literally the first day of kindergarten not as prepared as their classmates are to be successful so i start with early childhood education and universal prekindergarten thats where i grave disservice to ignore the fact that the first five years of life set up a child set up the vocabulary of that child we now know from brain research even influences the brain in ways that will make it easier or less so in learning the brain research tells us that of your brain is physically formed by the age of three so what happens in those first three years and then those first five years before you ever go into a formal classroom really depends on the family and the community and what kinds of support families can be given i am a strong believer in early education particularly for kids that have various kinds of disadvantages and i just tell you a quick story when bill was governor of arkansas one of our problems it was you know the second poorest state in america and our teachers were the second poorest page in america and a lot of our families had really a serious economic challenges and so when youre thinking about ok what do you do to try to improve the schools we we tackled standards we raised teacher pay we did a lot that needed to be done that was overdue but we also looked at this problem about what happens when kids show up that first day and as a result i began looking all over to try to find an affordable program that could help more lowincome kids be better prepared because a lot of programs that are the real state of the art are expensive and i would love for our country to invest in them because you actually save money at the end of it thats been proven over and over again but being realistic we gotta find everything we can do and try to make it affordable so this was so serendipitous i was in florida with bill we were attending some meeting that he had and i was just literally in the hotel room flip into the paper and i saw a picture of a professor from israel giving a lecture about a program that started there i read about it and it was fascinating because it basically said that after a big influx of immigrants from poor nations like ethiopia the kids would go to the excellent israeli schools but they werent achieving the israeli researchers at hebrew university was a way whats going on here were there in the schools if the schools were the only answer why arent they doing better and then they realize that they had to work in the family in those first five years so i called this woman her name was lombard and i said dr lumbered hillary clinton im calling from arkansas where and i said arkansas she goes wheres that i said well its sort of next to texas ok look at a map and i asked her if she were coming to the united states i would like to meet with her to figure out whether what they did in israel was transferable to places like arkansas she came and we began whats called the home instruction program for preschool youngsters and basically the idea behind it was to help the mother become her childs first teacher to feel confident and competent enough to try to prepare her own child to learn doing very simple things like talking to her baby a lot of lowincome mothers when i started doing this back in the eighties i would say i bet youre loving talking to your baby and theyd see why would i talked to her she cant talk back not because she didnt love her baby but because she had no idea thats how you build brain so and synapses and vocabulary so fast forward this program has now been going on across the country for years and it has a great track record so we can do more in the homes helping parents childs first teachers but we still need universal prekindergarten so that every child can get that level of preparation so that when they go to that first day of kindergarten they have a fighting chance to be successful so theres a lot i want to do but i end there by saying that i am really looking forward to working with the teachers and parents of america to make our education system everything it should be the drug issue in our state and we are grandparents raising grandson we lost him too and i knew i loved you for fifteen years retired here would you please just say a bit more even though youre probably preaching to the choir well i have to say you are the third grandmother that i have personally met in new hampshire the last several months whos raising a grandchild because of drugs we did have a an incredible town hall here didnt remotely six seven hundred people most of them really affected in some way or another by this terrible epidemic of addiction and in particular here in new hampshire and next door in vermont heroin and heroin epidemic which is killing so many young people and leaving grieving and broken families behind i dont think i would have been talking about this issue had i not spent several months listening to people and and i won my first trip in this campaign and then in new hampshire in keen on my first trip as with joanne and some others i heard about the heroin epidemic and so i began looking into it and i know that everywhere i went somebody raised it with me sometimes publicly sometimes afterwards privately so thats why i have a comprehensive agenda to try to begin to reverse this tide of addiction it includes better preventive efforts it includes more treatment something that we just dont have enough of if you do have somebody and you persuade them to seek treatment only one in will get it in a timely way because we dont have enough of it we also are seeing real progress and laconia i had a meeting about this issue and was so impressed by the police chief who has changed the whole way he polices drug abuse and drug offences of sending people to jail theres trying to get people into treatment theyre trying to match them with some kind of mint or from the recovery community and they are now equipped with the antidote to reverse heroin overdoses next alone known as nor can we have to change the way we police we need to break away here the usa houses gambling briefly would be a terrible mistake for the industry to be able to use their influence in congress to stop states from doing exactly as you said looking into it finding out more about it and i want more research to because i think youre right there are some you know there are some forms of this that are lifesavers you know droughtresistant crops are often genetically modified and we dont want to deprive people in drought conditions from being able to grow crops that they then can use unless there is evidence research that shows they shouldnt do it but on the other hand we need an ongoing system doing much more to check out all the chemicals and genetic changes and its not just gmos im worried about we have hundreds if not thousands of chemicals that we have never tested to determine what their real impact is or in concert with other elements or other chemicals so im im a huge believer in and safety and in the right to know and i think we are not doing enough on either of those counts so right now thats where i stand on it i am not in any way bro just forward no questions asked i think thats not smart but im also not anti no questions asked theres no possible uses for these kinds of altered crops which weve been eating as you know for hundreds of years in different forms its just much more sophisticated now but i am very much in favor of making sure its labeled making sure that no state or local community is stopped from doing what it thinks is right and much more money by independent sources in looking at the impact so we have better information in the first place not let somebody else asked question back here ive had my back ive had my back to the whole time have at this young lady in the keene state debate debate so ago and im majoring in holocaust and genocide studies and my amazing professors and classmates and i are wondering what your plans are for genocide and mass atrocity awareness and prevention and specifically what the plans for the atrocities prevention board would look like i think maybe the first college in the country to have a holocaust genocide studies program right and i join in the applause i think thats absolutely amazing and brilliant to have a specific curriculum to look at holocaust studies and genocide because weve got to have educated young people and others like you who are equipped to help us deal with a lot of these issues because unfortunately we are living with them and we have to come up with a better response i was privileged to announce the atrocities prevention board when it was first set up in the obama administration in washington if any of you have been there it was the most appropriate perfect place to make that announcement and i will certainly not only continue it but look for ways that its visibility can become higher so that more people know that the united states has this board and that we will work to find ways to try to bring people together around some common responses to the potential for genocide learning from the past and there are so many bows kind of theoretical and practical aspects to this that deserve a lot of thought for example we know that oftentimes in conflicts ethnic religious tribal other leaders of groups actually set these genocides or ethnic cleansing in motion they use the media we saw that in bosnia where people who had lived together peacefully for a very long time were set against each other through a propaganda effort on the media that turned neighbor against neighbor and even split families so we have to understand quickly if something like that is happening what are the best ways to try to combat it we saw the same thing in rwanda we have seen the same thing in the central african republic between christians and muslims and their political battles so we have to we have to not only condemn this and speak out against the horrible effects of the holocaust of genocide of atrocities but we have to really analyze it and thats why im so proud of the course youre doing what triggers it what turns people against one another who have been maybe not loving each other but not killing each other and then all of a sudden there something sets them off and how do we try to have interventions that prevent that and its a lot of cultures are on a trip wire something can set them off so how do we help other countries with the huge variety of cultures in the world understand what they need to do to try to prevent it from escalating so im im delighted and i hope that those who are in this program and graduate from it will find you know ways in our government ways and international organization in not for profits to be really actively involved in helping us understand what to do to prevent this from happening in the future here comes a microphone more difficult to get through there comes thank you for taking my question protected the american people in the american economy for decades and then it was dismantled and we crashed and hit bottom at the debate you said you would not be in support of reinstating glass steagle im wondering why and also if you become president how would you protect us from grove banks and wall street i intend to do just that and my plan is more comprehensive more effective in fact tougher and take a look at paul krugmans column today paul krugman who i think has pretty amazing progressive credentials right basically said that i had the better side of this argument now why did he say this because i fully respect my colleagues who have said lets reinstate glass steagle and if i thought that alone would prevent the potential next crisis had raised my hand and join but thats not my assessment because if you look as krugman said today in his column the some of the major actors who caused the crash were not big banks they would have never been covered by glass steagle aig the giant insurance company lehman brothers they would never have been affected by it and what i want to do is to crack down on the banks by assessing a risk fee and forcing them to have to comply with doddfrank and tougher regulations and i am absolutely in favor of breaking them up if they become a risk to the economy but the potential next threat to our economy that has to really be reined in is whats called the shadow banking world the hedge funds the money market funds when do anything about that if it were reinstated tomorrow so i have the greatest respect for my colleagues and former colleagues who are really focused on that but i go further than that my proposal which you can go to my website and read about goes much further and includes everybody that i think would pose a risk to the economy including the big banks but going much further than that so thats why ive taken the position i havent you can read paul krugman today to understand why ok this young man i think it had his hand up for a long time and hes got a cheering section behind him hes brought his own cheerleaders who are bisexual member of the lgbt community equal rights has been a very important thing to me you said that over the years your views on this topic of a bald how do you compare yourself to other candidates that have remained firm on their views and how do you think youve done to change from year past views well i think that if you speak with the human rights campaign or any of the large advocacy groups they will tell you that they count on me and that you can count on me i was i think the first and only first lady ever to march in a gay pride parade back in the late nineteen nineties so i have been an advocate a vocal visible advocate for equality and against discrimination yes my views did evolve and i think most people my age would say the same thing there might be some exceptions but largely because of my strong opposition to discrimination of any sort and my personal relationships with a lot of people over the years i certainly concluded that marriage equality should be the law of the land and i was thrilled when the supreme court made it the law of the land and i will i will enforce marriage equality but weve got to go further than that you know in a lot of states now because of the constitutional decision you can get married on saturday and get fired on monday because we still permit discrimination in employment and public accommodations so we have to pass the equality act which is currently pending in congress that will be my highest priority so that marriage isnt the end of the debate its a step along the path to true equality and you will be able to count on me to fight for you go of your red nurse for twenty five years in a longterm care setting and were faced with a lot of challenges that im sure many people have experience from medicare cuts to drug companies gouge people weve recently had an individual that was being charged for seven days of medication which is just not something people have but in the bigger scheme right now is the nursing shortage that is plaguing the country and its going to gain momentum as baby boomers retire and new hampshires experiencing at the longterm care industry is experiencing as the hospital do you have any thoughts on what we can do because when were looking at standards of care and quality and the things that we want for our loved ones but yet then people going into the industry challenge between their workload how do we manage that and how do we make it possible to raise the number of nurses out there serving our community and i think people know or should know that nursing care is often the single biggest reason people you either get well and recover or not so the nurse is at the center of the health care system and a couple of things about this one the last time i looked most nursing programs were oversubscribed by people wanting to get into them there were far more applicants than there were places for them so i think we should be expanding our training programs are educational programs so that we can actually trained more nurses so we can get ahead of what is a very serious problem with the retirement of a lot of baby boom nurses and the fact that were just not gonna have enough of a supply if we dont start trying to fill the pipeline now so there are some excellent programs but were gonna have to open additional excellent programs and were gonna have to try to support and i would be in favor of federal support for programs that have a proven track record of turning out excellent nurses so that they can expand more faculty more slots so that they can add to the numbers who can get into the profession early i also think its important that nurses be given more authority in the medical settings in which they work we know that a lot of nurses are being overworked theyre being asked to serve very long shifts and a lot of them now because the numbers have shrunk in a lot of settings particularly hospital settings and i think nursing home settings as well nurses are responsible for many more patients and nurses with whom i have spoken have all said this is unsustainable because if youve ever shadowed a nurse which i did back in its exhausting you know in and out of patients rooms i was in a hospital stopping to do the checking with doctors filling out the forms by the end of the shift youre just drained and if youre trying to take care of too many patients the result can be you know unfortunate because were not setting up our systems to get the best possible care so i think im both ends more training more education more support for those programs and try to make sure that nurses on the job have the support and the authority that they need thats how i would try to approach this one more question mike theres a lot of hands up your mic so im gonna let you pick whoever is with your eyes shut ok all right bring us back to student loans miami senior year at keene state elementary education department in the last three years all of my loans have been through credit card company because my parents make too much money and my fast and come to help me a year while they dont have a year to give me towards my education so i have extremely high interest rates and the only way i now have any federal support for this year is because i got married last summer so i just find it mind blowing and im still the same person whos been with the scene partner for six years in and ive had the same parents with seem jobs the same income financial situation but now the government says hey now we can help you because you got married and before that i wasnt worth any federal help i had to go through credit card companies i cant stand that i think thats terrible and so were gonna change that i think that application is absurd i mean it is just absolutely perfect storm application turns people off and it penalizes people like your parents so its a lose lose no matter where you start from the parents plus loans i dont know if any of you have those have become so expensive and way beyond the means most families to be able to manage the federal government should not be making a profit off of student loans that is example is the same person that families can make a contribution fine but it has to be reasonable if students can work i work so i maybe im a little biased hours a week to be able to get debt free tuition which is my goal debt free tuition you never have to borrow a penny to pay tuition for public college or university like keene state so that will be caught and just generally become you know so wrong a young woman i think in nevada say to me you know the hardest part about going to college shouldnt be figuring out how to pay for it and the amount of stress and anguish and disappointment from young people and their families is just beyond anything it should ever be and the other problem which i encountered back and forth in talking to people about all of this is that a lot of young people who try to start and then something happens and they drop out they are stuck with the loans and they dont have anything to show for it because they never got their degree and the worst offenders are some not all i want to make that very clear some of the not for profit college or the forprofit colleges that are pretty unscrupulous and how they treat students and their parents and one of the most groups are veterans under the new gi bill have the opportunity to get an education and a lot of these forprofit colleges try to recruit the vets and then they basically take the money under one of the loopholes in the law and dont produce the results for our vets so there are a number of issues here that im gonna be confronting and you know the debt free tuition would be a big help to you thats going to be one of my primary goal is to make college more affordable and to get the debt load down and hopefully eliminated in a more reasonable way than what youre facing thank you all very muchthank you i dont know what i want and i want everyone of you i still country were going to fight for everybody and everything gonna fight for real solutions that make a real difference in peoples lives you know when i started this campaign last spring i knew we were facing profound challenges as a country the way too many things were going just wasnt right it isnt right the kids i met in flint on sunday were poisoned because their governor wanted to save money it is that right grandmother here in new hampshire or anywhere else you have to choose between paying rent and buying medicine because a prescription drug company increased the price four thousand percent overnight and it is it right that a cashier that i met here in new hampshire son is paid less than her son doing the same work even though shes been on the job for more years now people people have every right to be angry but theyre also hungry hungry for solutions what are we going the fire were taking the country what is the best way to change peoples lives so we can all go together who is the best change maker work harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better in this campaign youve heard a lot about washington and about wall street now senator sanders and i both wanna get secret unaccountable money out of politics and lets remember remember citizens united one of the worst supreme court decisions in our countrys history was actually a case about a right wing attack on the and my campaign a rightwing organization aimed at me and ended up damaging our entire democracy so yes youre not going to find anybody more committed to aggressive campaign we also agree that wall street can never be allowed to once again threaten made street and i will fight to rein in wall street and you know what i know how to do it bank cant be too big to fail and no executive too powerful to jail you can count on it now the real differences in this race are truly over how do we create a future of prosperity opportunity and security for all of us we need to build a growth and fairness economy with higher wages and more goodpaying jobs including a bold national mission to create millions of jobs in clean energy manufacturing and infrastructure unleash again the innovation of our entrepreneurs and small businesses make it easier for parents to balance work and family close the loopholes in our tax code crackdown on corporations that game the system stop other countries from taking advantage of us with unfair trade practices but even all that is not enough we also have to break through the barriers of bigotry africanamerican parents shouldnt have to worry that their children will be harassed humiliated because of the color of their skin immigrant families have to lie awake at night listening for a knock on the door lgbt americans shouldnt be fired from their jobs because the home and lets finally delivers something long overdue equal pay for women and how i feel president has to do all parts the job for all americans to make sure nothing holds you back not dead discrimination not a deck thats always stacked with those at the top we need to break down those barriers and build ladders of opportunity for every person thats how we will build a better tomorrow together and that has been the cause and work of my life you know my family and i they taught me a simple credo do all the good you can in all the ways you can for all the people you can thats what called me to a life of service just like millions of teachers and nurses and police officers and firefighters and members of our armed services get up every day and do why it work the heroic work for all the rest of us but when children anywhere in our country go to bed hungry or are denied a quality education or who face abuse or abandonment that this finishes all of us thats why i did start my career the childrens defense fund thats why i went undercover in alabama to expose racism in schools thats why i worked for juvenile justice and south carolina and that is why i went to flint michigan on sunday anywhere in america are held back by injustice that demands action that is why i believe so strongly that we have to keep up with every fiber of our being given for the campaign for human rights human rights as women rights human rights as gay rights human rights as worker rights human rights as voting rights right across the board for every single american now that that is who i am that is what ive always done that is why i am in this race i know i have some work to do particularly with young people but i will repeat again what i have said this way even if they are not supporting me now i support them because i know a blessed life but i also know what its like to stumble and fall and so many people across america know that feeling and weve learned its not whether you get knocked down that matters its whether you get back building on the progress weve made under president obama pushing forward every single day for as long as it takes to break down those barriers that hold us back weve got to believe in the basic proposition of our country when all americans have the chance to succeed when each of us has the opportunity to live up to our own godgiven potential then and only then can america live up to its potential as well thank all of you i am very grateful to my wonderful family knowing there by my side keeps me going thousands of volunteers and organizers who called neighbors and knocked on doors and then hillary clinton dot com to give what you could more than people have contributed to this campaign the vast majority having less than i know that doesnt fit with the narrative i know there are those who want to deny the passion and the purpose you all show every day for this campaign but you are there is that we are here and you are the reason we are going to win the nomination at that where theres so much shit together thank you thank you sirahead on bernie sanders right now what a great campaign their shares to campaign across iowa with so many of you to make the case for the kind of future we want for the democratic party and for the united states of america there is so much at stake in this election i dont need to tell you every single one of you who came out for me to work so many hours from my young organizers with energy families and friends across this state i am deeply grateful well heres what i want you to know it is rare it is rare that we have the opportunity we do now to have a real contest of ideas joe really think hard about what the democratic party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it ima progressive who gets things done to stand in the long line of american reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough but standing still is not an option and that brings people together to find ways forward that will improve the lives of americans i look back over the years my involvement from that very first job i had at the childrens defense fund and i know we are capable of doing i know we can create more goodpaying jobs and raise incomes for hardworking americans again i know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage i know we can come back climate change and be that clean energy superpower eventually force we can make our education system work for every one of our children especially at all disadvantages we can make college affordable and get stoned and dad off the backs of young people our rights womens rights workers rights we can stand up to the gun lobby and get commonsense gun safety manager we do that we do that by securing the nomination and then we do it by winning and going in at white house as others be four have determined to push forward on the great goals and values that unite us as americans i congratulate i congratulate my esteemed friends and opponents i wish governor omalley the very best hes a great public servant who has served our country cited about really getting into the debate with senator sanders about the best way for in the last few weeks in the last few weeks we finally began to have what i think is one of the most important substantive conversations that the democratic party could have and i am i am thrilled at all the people who are playing a part in that i know that we may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals but i believe we have a very clear idea that the democratic party and this campaign stands for what is best in america and we have to we had to be united against a republican vision and candidates who would drive us apart and divide us that is not who we are my friends i followed their campaign very closely i understand what theyre appealing to and i intend to stand against it i will the progress that weve made be successful because we cant afford that so as i stand here tonight breathing a big sigh of relief thank you standing up for you i will keep fighting for you i will always work to achieve the america that i believe in where the promise of that dream that we hold out to our children and our grandchildren never fades but its spires generations to join a lets goeveryone at the new school for welcoming us today im delighted to be back over the past few months i have had the opportunity to listen to americans concerns about an economy that still isnt delivering for them its not delivering the way that it should it still seems to most americans i have spoken with that it is stacked for those at the top but ive also heard about the hopes that people have for their future going to college without drowning in debt starting that small business theyve always dreamed about getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement previous generations of americans built the greatest economy and strongest middleclass the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain if you work hard and do your part you should be able to get ahead and when you get ahead america gets ahead but over the past several decades that bargain has eroded our job is to make it strong again for years republicans have argued that if we give more well to those at the top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules it will trickle down it will trickle down to everyone else yet every time they have a chance to try that approach it explodes the national death concentrates well even more and does practically nothing to help hardworking americans twice now in the past years a democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind i think the results speak for themselves under president clinton i like the sound of that america saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history nearly million jobs a balanced budget and a surplus for the future and most importantly incomes rose across the board not just for those already at the top eight years later president obama and the american peoples hard work hold us back from the brink of depression president obama saved the auto industry imposed new rules on wall street and provided health care to million americans now today day as the shadow of crisis recedes and longerterm challenges come into focus i believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy you cant have one without the other we cant create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth and we cant build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness we need both because while america is standing again were not yet running the way we should corporate profits are at near record highs and americans are working as hard as ever but thx barely budged in real terms families today are stretched in so many directions and so are their budgets out of pocket costs health care child care caring for aging parents are rising a lot faster than wages i hear this everywhere i go a single mom who talked to me about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids she doesnt expect anything to come easy but if you got a raise everything wouldnt be quite so hard the grandmother who worked around the clock providing child care to other peoples kids shes proud of her work but the pay is barely enough to live on especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs the young entrepreneur whose dream of buying the bowling out where he worked at the teenager was nearly derailed by his student depth if you can grow his business will be able to pay off his debt and pay its employees including himself more to millions of hardworking americans tell similar stories leeches need to rise to keep up with costs paychecks need to grow families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead the defining economic challenge of our time is clear we must raise incomes for hardworking americans so they can afford a middleclass life we must drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country and that im president to the left eye i will get up everyday thinking about the families of america like the family that i came from a hardworking dad is starting a small business and scrimped and saved and gave us a good middleclass life ill be thinking about all the people that i represented here in new york and the stories that they told me and that i worked with them to improve and i will as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that didnt start with the recession and wont end with the recovery you know advances in technology and expanding global trade have created a whole new areas of commercial activity and open new markets for exports but too often theyre also polarizing our economy benefiting highskilled workers but displacing or downgrading bluecollar jobs and other midlevel jobs that used to provide incomes for millions of americans todays marketplace focuses too much on the shortterm like second to second financial trading and quarterly earnings reports and too little on longterm investments meanwhile many americans are making extra money renting out a spare room designing websites selling products they design themselves at home or even driving their own car this on demand or socalled big economy is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation but its also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future so all of these trends are real and none none is going away but they dont determine our destiny the choices we make as a nation matter and the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what american life in the middle class in our economy will be like in this century as president i will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us to strengthen not how about the american middle class is i think it our best thats what americans do we are problem solvers not deniers we dont hide from change we harness the measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families not just for successful ceos and money managers and not just some arbitrary growth target untethered to peoples lives and livelihoods i want our economy work for the struggling striving and the successful were not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past we cant go back to the old policies that failed us before nor can we just replay the successes today is not its not so we needed a solution for the big challenges we face now so today im proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking americans an agenda for strong growth their growth and longterm growth let me begin with strong growth more growth means more jobs and more new businesses more jobs give people choices about where to work and employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones thats why economist how us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes small businesses create more than of new american jobs on net so they have to be a top priority ive said i want to be the small business president and i mean it and throughout this campaign im going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape easier access to capital tax relief and simplification however push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in america closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas and i know its not always how we think about this but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform i want you to hear this bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated billion dollars over years then there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs create the next generation of highpaying jobs know when we get americans moving we get our country moving so lets establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private fun those funds to finance worldclass airports railways roads bridges and ports and lets build those faster broadband networks and make sure theres a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice and really theres no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now our economy obviously runs on energy and the time has come to make america the worlds clean energy superpower i dedicate that because these investments will create millions of jobs save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change and lets fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the nineteen nineties and president obamas initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years i will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead but today let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued breaking down barriers more americans participate more fully in the work force especially women we are in a global competition as im sure you have noticed and we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines but thats exactly what were doing today when we leave people out or write them off we not only shortchanged them and their dreams we shortchange our country and our future the movement of women into the american workforce over the past years was responsible for more than three and a half trillion dollars in economic growth but that progress has stalled the united states used to rank seventh out of advanced countries in womens labor force participation by we had dropped to ninety that represents a lot of fun used potential for our economy and for american families studies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because theyre expanding family friendly policies like paid leave and we are not we should be making it easier for americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying everyday about how theyre going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member get sick you know last year while i was at the hospital here in manhattan waiting for a little charlotte to make a grand entrance one of the nurses said thank you for fighting for paid leave and we began to talk about it she sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of its time to recognize that quality affordable child care is not a luxury its a growth strategy and its way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job and women of color making even less this lost money adds up for some women its thousands of dollars every year now i am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as womens issues all those days are over their pay and fair scheduling paid family leave and earned sick days childcare are essential to our competitiveness and our growth and we can do this in a way that doesnt impose unfair burdens on businesses especially small businesses as president our fight to put families first just like i have my entire career now beyond strong growth we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of raising incomes the evidence is in in a quality is a drag on our entire economy so this is the problem we need to tackle now you may have heard governor bush say last week that americans just need to work longer hours well he must not have met very many american workers led him to tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the teacher who is in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night let him talk about to the fastfood workers marching in the streets for better pay they dont need a lecture they need a raise the truth is the current rules for our economy to reward some work like financial trading for example much more than other work like actually building and selling things that work that has always been the backbone of our economy to get all incomes rising again we need to strike a better balance if you work hard you are to be paid fairly so we do have to raise the minimum wage and implement president obamas new rules on overtime and then we have to go further crackdown on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors or even steal their wages to make paycheck stretch we need to take on the major strain on family budgets ill protect the affordable care act and build on it to lower outofpocket health care costs and to make prescription drugs more affordable will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing social security and making it easier to save for the future how many of these proposals are timetested and more than a little battlescarred we need new ideas as well and one that i believe in and will fight for is profitsharing hard working americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help reduce so i will propose ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees thats good for workers and good for businesses studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a state in a companys success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees pockets its a winwin later this week in new hampshire ill have more to say about how we do this another priority must be performing our tax code now we hear republican candidates talked a lot about tax reform but take a good look at their plans senator rubios would cut taxes for households making around three million dollars a year by almost which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family well thats a sure budgetbusting giveaway to the super wealthy and thats the kind of bad economics youre likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side i have a different take guided by some simple principle first hardworking families need and deserve tax relief and simplification second those at the top half to pay their fair share thats why i support the buffett rule which make sure that millionaires dont pay lower rates than their secretaries ive also called for closing the carried interest loophole which lets wealthy financier pay an artificially low rate and lets agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything america has to offer should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share especially while companies who cant afford highpriced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more alongside tax reform its time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power which has been proven again and again to drive up wages republican governors like scott walker have made their names stomping on workers rights and practically all the republican candidates hope to do the same as president i will fight back against these meanspirited misguided attacks evidence evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase in equality among men we want to get serious about raising incomes we have to get serious about supporting union workers and let me just say a word here about three the greek crisis as well as the chinese stock market have reminded us that grows here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades but has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hardworking communities so we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements we should support them if they create jobs raise wages and advance our national security and we should be prepared to walk away if they dont to create their growth we need to create opportunity for more americans i love thing by abraham lincoln who in many ways was not only a president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of government laying its role in providing opportunities talked about giving americans a fair chance in the race of life i believe that with all my heart but i also believe it has to start really early at birth highquality early learning especially in the first five years and set children on the course for future success and raised lifetime incomes by and im every year old in america have access to highquality preschool in the next ten years but i wanna do more i want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community our business community are academic institutions from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens who really help parents particularly parents work see seeing a lot of obstacles to really help prepare their own children in that age group eighty percent of your brain is typically formed by the age of three thats why families like mine read talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter have said that her first words gonna be enough with the reading and the copying of a singing but we do it not only because we love doing it even though ill admit its a little embarrassing reading a book to a twoweek older sixweek older we go but we do it because we understand its building capacity for learning and the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten she will have heard thirty million more words than a child from a less advantaged background of what we are losing because were not doing everything we can to reach out to those families and we know again from so much research here the united states and around the world at that early help that mentoring that intervention to help those often stressed out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to really get their child off to the best possible start we also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level and in the coming weeks and months i will lay out specific steps to improve our schools make college truly affordable and help americans refinance their student debt and lets embrace life long learning in an age of technological change we need to provide pathways to get skills who credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs there are exciting efforts underway and i want to support and scale the ones that show results as we pursue all these policies we cant forget our fellow americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world and the inner cities to call country indian country calendar is universal you find it everywhere but opportunity is not there are nearly six million young people aged to in america today who are not in school or at work the numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering a quarter of young black men and nearly fifteen percent of all latino youth cannot find a job weve got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class i firmly believe that the best anti poverty program is a job but thats hard to say if there arent enough jobs for people that were trying to help lift themselves out of poverty thats why ive called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas when were all americans have the chance to study hard work hard and share in our countrys prosperity thats their growth its what ive always believed in its what i will fight for as president now the driver of income alongside strong growth and fear growth must be longterm growth too many pressures in our economy push us toward shorttermism many business leaders see this theyve talked to me about it one is called it the problem of quarterly capitalism they say everythings focused on the next earnings report for the shortterm share price and the result is too little attention on the sources of longterm growth research and development physical capital and talent net business investment which includes things like factories machines and research labs have declined as a share of the economy in recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends doesnt leave a lot left to raise page or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a companys future success these trends need to change and i believe that many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities not just todays share price but also to workers communities and ultimately to our country and indeed our planet no im not talking about charity im talking about clear id capitalism many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yields higher productivity better service and larger profits now its easy to try to cut costs by holding down or even decreasing pay and other investments to inflate for daily stock prices but i would argue thats bad for business in the long run and its really bad for our country workers are assets investing in them pays off higher wages payoff training pays off to help more companies do that i proposed a new tax credit for every worker they train and hire and i will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longerterm investments that create jobs more than just quick trades i will also propose reforms to help ceos and shareholders alike focus on the next decade rather than just the next day making sure arent being used only for an immediate boost in share prices empowering outside investors who want to build companies but discouraging cut and run shareholders who act more like oldschool corporate raiders and nowhere will the shift from shortterm to longterm be more important than on wall street as a former senator from new york i know firsthand the role that wall street can and should play in our economy helping main street grow and prosper and boosting new companies that make america more competitive globally but as we all know in the years before the crash financial firms piled risk upon risk and regulators in washington either couldnt or wouldnt keep up i was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight under president obamas leadership weve imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on wall street but those rules have been under assault by republicans in congress and those running for president i will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms weve made we can do that and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust we also have to go beyond doddfrank too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky and the problems are not limited to the big banks to get all the headlines serious risks are emerging from institutions in the socalled shadow banking system including hedge funds highfrequency traders nonbank finance companies so many new kinds of entities which received little oversight at all stories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking hsbc allowing drug cartels to launder money five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates there can be no justification for tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior and in some cases admitted guilt too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all even when theyve already pocketed gains this is wrong and on my watch it will change over the course over the course of this campaign i will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on wall street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors not just highfrequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections i will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem will ensure will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee and we will prosecute individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing and when the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public if you go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public it could for example help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers now reform is never easy but weve done it before in our country and we have to get it right this time and yes we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us two years ago the head of the chicago mercantile exchange terry duffy published an oped in the wall street journal that really caught my attention he wrote and i quote im concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who we serve and that the public knows it some wall streeters can too easily into regarding their work as a kind of money making game divorced and the concerns of main street i think we should listen to terry duffy of course longterm growth is only possible if the public sectors steps up as well so its time to end the era of budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one cell phone inflicted crisis to another its time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how were going to tackle the big stuff together how do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing what are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors like silicon valley questions like these demand for oil and mature debate from our policymakers in government from our leaders in the private sector are economists are academics others who can come together to the table and on behalf of america performed their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and are middleclass keeps growing government has to be smarter simpler more focused itself on longterm investments than shortterm politics and be a better partner to cities states and the private sector washington has to be a better steward of americans tax dollars and americans trust and please lets get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology thats what ill do as president i will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality i wanna have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together and i will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable including by continuing to restrain health care costs which remain one of the key drivers of longterm deficits i will make sure washington learns from how well local governments businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across america no passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress as president i will use the power to convene connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually gets things done because above all we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the longterm needs of our country i confess maybe its the grandmother and me but i believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade youll never sit and the vision ive laid out here today strong growth hair growth and longterm growth all working together will get incomes rising again will help working families get ahead and stay ahead that is the test of our time and im inviting everyone to please join me to do your part thats what great countries do thats what our country always has done we rise to challenges its not about left right or center about the future versus the past im running for president to build an america for tomorrow not yesterday an america built on growth in fairness and america where if you do your part you will reap the rewards where we dont need anyone i just want one more thought i want every child every child in our country not just the grand daughter of a former president or former secretary of state but every child to have the chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential please join me in that mission lets do it together thank you all so muchmore dangerous path leading to a far less certain and riskier future thats why i support this deal i supported as part of a larger strategy toward iran by now the outcome in congress is no longer in much doubt so weve got to start looking ahead to what comes next enforcing the deal deterring iran and its proxies and strengthening our allies these will be my goals as president and today i want to talk about how i would achieve them let me start by saying i understand the skepticism so many feel about iran i too am deeply concerned about iranian aggression and the need to confront it its a ruthless brutal regime that has the blood of americans many others including its own people on its hands its political rallies read sound with cries of death to america its leaders talk about wiping israel off the face of the map most recently just yesterday and foment terror against it there is absolutely no reason to trust iran now vice president cheney may hope that the american people will simply forget but the truth is by the time president obama took office and i became secretary of state iran was racing toward a nuclear capability they had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle meaning that they had the material scientists and technical know how to create material for nuclear weapons they had produced and installed thousands of centrifuges expanded their secret facilities established a robust uranium enrichment program and defied their international obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and they hadnt suffered many consequences whose i voted for sanctions again and again as a senator from new york but they werent having much effect most of the world still did business with iran we needed to step up our game so president obama and i pursued a twoprong strategy pressure and engagement we made it clear that the door to diplomacy was open if iran answer the concerns of the international community in a serious and credible way we simultaneously launched a comprehensive campaign to significantly raise the cost of iranian defiance we systematically increased our military capabilities in the region deepening our cooperation with partners and sending more firepower and additional aircraft carrier battle ship strike aircraft and the most advanced radar and missile defense systems available meanwhile i traveled the world capital by capital leader by leader twisting arms to help build the global coalition that produced some of the most effective sanctions in history with president obamas leadership we worked with congress and the european union to cut iran off from the world economic and financial system and one by one we persuaded energyhungry consumers of iranian oil like india and south korea to cut back soon irans tankers said rusting in port its economy was collapsing these new measures were effective because we made them global american sanctions provided the foundation but iran didnt really feel the heat until we turn this into an international campaign so by adding that iran had no choice but to negotiate they could no longer play off one country against another they had no place to hide so they started looking for a way out i first visited on mon to speak with the sultan of oman and j january of went back later that year assault on helped set up a secret back channel i set one of my closest aides as part of a small team to begin talks with the iranians in secret negotiations began in earnest after the iranian election in first the bilateral talks led by deputy secretary bill burns and jake sullivan that led to the interim agreement then the multilateral talks led by secretary john kerry secretary ernie moniz and undersecretary wendy sherman now theres a comprehensive agreement on irans nuclear program is it perfect of course not no agreement like this ever is but is it a strong agreement yes it is and we absolutely should not turn it down the merits of the deal have been well argued so i wont go through them in great detail here the bottom line is that it accomplishes the major goals we set out to achieve it blocks every pathway iran to get a bomb and it gives us better tools for verification and inspection and to compel rigorous compliance without a deal irans breakout time how long they need to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon which ring to a couple of months with a deal that breakout time stretches to a year which means that if iran cheats will know it and well have time to respond decisively without a deal we would have no credible inspections of irans nuclear facilities with a deal will have unprecedented access well be able to monitor every aspect of their nuclear program now some have expressed concern that certain nuclear restrictions expire after years and we need to be vigilant about that which ill talk more about in a moment but other parts are permanent including irans obligations under the nonproliferation treaty and their commitment to enhanced inspections under the additional protocol others have expressed concern that it could take up to days to gain access to some of irans facilities when we suspected cheating id be the first to say that this part of the deal is not perfect although the deal does allow for daily access to enrichment facilities and monitoring of the entire nuclear fuel cycle important to focus on that because being able to monitor the supply chain is critical to what we will find out and how we will be able to respond but our experts tell us that even with delayed access to some places this deal does the job microscopic nuclear particles remain for years and years they are impossible to hide thats why secretary moniz a nuclear physicist has confidence in this plan and some have suggested that we just go back to the negotiating table and get a better unspecified to you i can certainly understand why that may sound appealing but as someone who started these talks in the first place and built our global coalition piecebypiece i can assure you it is not realistic plus if we walk away now our capacity to sustain and enforce sanctions will be severely diminished we will be blamed not the iranians so if we were to reject this agreement iran would be poised to get nearly everything it wants without giving up a thing no restrictions on their nuclear program no real warning if tehran suddenly rushes toward a bomb and the international sanctions regime would fall apart so no more economic sequences for iran either those of us who have been out there on the diplomatic front lines know that diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection its the balancing of risk and on balance the far riskier course right now would be to walk away great powers cant just junk agreements and expect the rest of the world to go along with us we need to be reasonable and consistent and we need to keep our word especially when were trying to lead a coalition thats how well make this and future deals work but its not enough just to say yes to this deal of course it is it we have to say yes and yes and we will enforce it with vigor and vigilance yes and we will embed it in a broader strategy to confront irans bad behavior in the region yes and we will begin from day one to set the conditions so iran knows it will never be able to get a nuclear weapon not during the term of the agreement not after not ever we need to be clear and i think we have to make that very clear to iran about what we expect from them this is not the start of some larger diplomatic opening and we shouldnt expect that this deal will lead to broader changes in their behavior that shouldnt be a promise or proceeding instead we need to be prepared for three scenarios first iran tries to cheat something its been quite willing to do in the past second iran tries to wait us out perhaps it wait to move for years when some but not all restrictions expire and rd year on ramps up its dangerous behavior in the region including its support for terrorist groups like hamas hola i believe that the success of this deal has a lot to do with how the next president grapples with these challenges so let me tell you what i would do my starting point will be one of just trust you remember president reagans line about the soviets trust but verify my approach will be distrust and verify we should anticipate that iran will test the next president theyll want to see how far they can bend the rules that wont work if im in the white house hold the line against iranian noncompliance that means penalties even for small violations keeping our allies on board but being willing to snap back sanctions into place unilaterally if we have to working with congress to close any gaps in the sanctions right now members of congress are offering proposals to that effect and i think the current administration should work with them to see whether there are additional steps that could be taken finally it means ensuring that the iaea has the resources it needs from finances to personnel to equipment to hold irans feet to the fire but the most important thing we can do to keep iran from cheating or trying to wait us out is to shape iranian expectations right from the start the iranians and the world need to understand that we will act decisively if we need to so heres my message to irans years the united states will never allow you to acquire a nuclear weapon as president i will take whatever actions are necessary to protect the united states and our allies i will not hesitate to take military action if iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon and i will set up my successor to be able to credibly make the same which we will make clear to iran that our national commitment to prevention will not waver depending on whos in office its permanent and should it become necessary in the future having exhausted peaceful alternatives to turn to military force we will have preserved and in some cases enhanced our capacity to act and because we have proven our commitment to diplomacy first the world more likely join us then theres the broader issue of countering irans bad behavior across the region taking nuclear weapons out of the equation is crucial because in iran with nuclear weapons is so much more dangerous than in iran without them but even without nuclear weapons we still see irans fingerprints on nearly every conflict across the middle east they support bad actors from syria to lebanon tn they vowed to destroy israel and thats worth saying again theyve to destroy israel we cannot ever take that lightly particularly when iran ships at vance missiles to hezbollah and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating israel for talks about how israel wont exist and twentyfive years just like he did today and in addition to all the malicious activity they already under right weve got to anticipate that iran could use some of the economic relief they get from this deal to pay for even more so as president i will raise the costs for their actions and confront them across the board my strategy will be based on strong pillars first i will deepen americas unshakable commitment to israels security including our longstanding tradition guaranteeing israels qualitative military edge increase support for israeli rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing ill sell israel the most sophisticated fighter aircraft ever developed the f will work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for northern israel which has been subjected to hezbollah attacks for years i will reaffirm that the persian gulf is a region of vital interest to the united states we dont want any of irans neighbors to develop or acquire a nuclear weapons program either so we want them to feel and be secure i will sustain a robust military presence in the region especially our air and naval forces will keep the strait of hormuz open will increase security cooperation with our gulf allies including intelligence sharing military support and missile defense to ensure they can defend against iranian aggression even if that takes the form of cyber attacks or other nontraditional threats iran should understand that the united states and i as president will not stand by as our gulf allies and partners are threatened we will act third i will build a coalition to counter irans proxies particularly hezbollah that means enforcing and strengthening the rules prohibiting the transfer of weapons to hezbollah looking at new ways to choke off their funding and pressing our partners to treat hezbollah as a terrorist organization it is its time to eliminate the false distinction that some still make between the supposed political and military wings if youre part of hezbollah youre part of a terrorist organization plane and simple beyond hezbollah crackdown on the shipment of weapons to hamas and pushed turkey and got her to end their financial support our press our partners in the region to prevent aircraft and ships owned by companies linked to irans revolutionary guard from entering their territories and urge our partners to block iranian planes entering their airspace on their way to yemen and syria across the board i will vigorously enforce and strengthened if necessary the american sanctions on iran and its revolutionary guard for its sponsorship of terrorism its ballistic missile program and other destabilizing activities all enforce and strengthened if necessary are restrictions on sending arms to iran and from iran to bad actors like syria and all imposes these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities whether theyre in iran or overseas this will be a special imperative as some of the un sanctions laps to the usa and our partners have to step up fourth ill stand as i always have against irans abuses at home from its detention of political prisoners to its crackdown on freedom of expression including online its inhumane policies hold back talented and spirited people are coral is not and never has been with the iranian people theyd have a bright future a hopeful future if they werent held back by their leaders as ive said before i think we were too restrained and our support of the protests in june and in our condemnation of the government crackdown that followed that wont happen again we will enforce and if need be broaden our human rights sanctions and i will not rest until every single american detained or missing in iran is home fifth just to the nuclear agreement needs to be embedded in a broader iran policy are broader iran policy needs to be embedded in a comprehensive regional strategy that promote stability and counters extremism tehran like isis benefits from chaos and strife and exploit other countries weaknesses and the best defense against iran are the countries and governments being strong that they can provide security and economic opportunity to their own people and they must have the tools to push back on radicalization and extremism helping countries get there will take time and strategic discipline but its crucial that the united states leads this effort i will push for renewed diplomacy to solve the destructive regional conflicts that iran fuels we have to bring sufficient pressure on assad to force a political solution in syria including a meaningful increase in our efforts to train and equip the moderate syrian opposition something i called for early in the conflict in the united states must lead and assisting those who have been uprooted by conflict especially the millions of syrian refugees now the seating the world to help them as pope francis has reminded reminded us this is an international problem that demands an international response united states must help lead that response thats who we are and thats what we do our strategy needs to cover all these bases irans nuclear ambitions and its support of terrorism its hatred of israel and its cruelty toward its citizens its military resources and its economic strengths and weaknesses we need to be creative committed and vigilant and on every front we need to keep working closely with our friends and partners on that note let me just been a minute speaking about the serious concerns that israels leaders have about this deal israel has every reason to be alarmed by a regime that both denies its existence and seeks its destruction i would not support this agreement for one second five thought it put israel in greater danger i believe in my cord that israel and america must stand sidebyside and i will i will always stand by israels right to defend itself as i always have i believe this deal and a joint strategy for enforcing it makes israel safer i say that with humility im not israeli i dont know what its like to live under constant threat from your neighbors in a country where the margin for error is so thin i know that my saying this deal makes you safer wont alleviate the very real fears of the israeli people but i have stood for israeli security for a very long time it was one of my bedrock principles as secretary of state thats why i supported stronger defense systems like iron dome anti rocket defense system which proved so effective in protecting israeli lives during the conflicts of and last summer its why ive worked closely with israel to advance the twostate vision of a jewish and democratic israel was secure and recognized borders and its why i believe we should expedite negotiations of a longterm military assistance agreement with israel lets not wait until when the current deal expires lets get it done this year i would invite israeli prime minister to the white house during my first month in office talk about all of these issues and to set us on a course of closed frequent consultation right from the start because we both rely on each other for support as partners allies and friends this isnt just about policy for me it is personal as president im committed to shoring up and strengthening the relationship between our countries we have had honest disagreements about this deal now is the time to come together now is the time to remember what unites us and build upon it and so i know well that the same forces that threaten israel threaten the united states and the people of israel let me say youll never have to question whether were with you the united states will always be with you there have also been honest disagreements about the nuclear deal here at home smart serious people and see issues like these differently like my friend chuck schumer whos going to be an excellent leader in the senate i respect the skepticism that he and others feel and i respect differences of opinion and people who advocated vigorously for their beliefs but i have a harder time respecting those who approached an issue as serious as this with on serious talk especially anyone running to be president of the united states several republican candidates boast tear up this agreement in more than a year after its been implemented thats not leadership thats recklessness it would set us right down the very dangerous path weve worked so hard to avoid im looking forward to a robust debate about foreign policy in this campaign where we have disagreements we should lay them out like if american ground forces in iraq should engage in direct combat as scott walker wants or if we should keep cuba closed as marco rubio and jeb bush want lets debate these issues but lets debate them on the basis of facts not fear lets resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those who disagree with us and lets avoid at all costs undermining americas credibility abroad that only makes us weaker and im going to call it out whenever i see it i spent four years representing america abroad as america secretary of state was one of the greatest privileges of my life and knowing that my fellow americans were counting on me and rooting for me not as democrats not as republicans but as americans meant a great deal we are all one team the american team and that doesnt change no matter how much we might disagree and i can tell you from personal experience we are stronger overseas when we are united at home so we simply have to find a way to work together better than we have been doing theres a lot of democrats and republicans can and should agree on the united states should lead in the middle east we can agree on that we should stand by our friends against iranian aggression we can agree on that too i believe that the plan ive laid out today as one that all americans could endorse and i hope they will the next president will face threats from many porters from those we see today like terrorism from isis aggressiveness from putin pandemics like ebola to all those we cant predict yet we need a leader who has a strong vision for the future and the skill and determination to get us there we cant stop the world from changing but we can help to shape those changes and we can do that by leading with strength smarts on yielding commitment to our values no i saw that when i was first lady senators secretary of state that when america leads with principal and purpose other people and governments are eager to join us no country comes close to matching are advantages the strength of our economy the skill of our workforce our tradition of innovation our unmatched network of alliances and partnerships so we are poised to remain the worlds most admired and powerful nation for a long time if we make the smart choices and practice smart leadership thats what i will try to do as your president and i believe as strongly as ever that our best days are ahead of us and that americas greatest contributions to the world are yet to come thank you all very much more dangerous path leading to a far less certain and riskier future thats why i support this deal i supported as part of a larger strategy toward iran by now the outcome in congress is no longer in much doubt so weve got to start looking ahead to what comes next enforcing the deal deterring iran and

we expect from them this is not the start of some largerleast a year college campus students here i want to thank for his choice to help us get organized and florida so when the primary and i think respect to hear all the other elected officials its exciting for me to have this opportunity to talk to you about this campaign to the countrys future and really to all of you but i also want to thank you for doing what darnell is doing and that it has registered to vote active in the campaign working chill at your candidate hopefully need and and everybody you can about why this election is so important now you know theres a lot of issues to talk about i want to say my campaign is focused on making sure that works to raise incomes and provides jobs everybody willing to work hard and do your part and excited about that because i believe i say this because i know all the facts backed me up yet tried it works better for america and americans we have a democrat in the white house and certainly look at all at the statistics now go back a long way unemployment is higher than the stock market is higher when i republicanism the white house you are or more times as likely to have a recession now i dont want to go all the way back to the beginning of our country to prove this lets just take the last years five presidents republicans and two democrats i know both of those democrats i will tell you each of problems from their republican predecessors in my husbands case with a little better than the national debt quadrupled in just years from george washington to rattle two world wars as civil war lots of other stuff and then to terms of george w bush and the deficit had gone way it looked like there were problems in the economy so my husband took a look at all of that got elected he said to me its so much worse than they told us and somebody asked what do you think you unique to washington cause he said were gonna get this to measure up again and work for americans and at the end of eight years we had million new jobs and most importantly incomes went up for everybody not just people at the top in the middle for people and we ended up with a balanced budget surplus well another republican president and they went back to the failed policies of trickledown economics didnt know the enemy years deficit was back up back up and we were facing the worst financial crisis since the great depression and the financial markets and the mortgage markets and you know what happened shortly after the election i got a call from president obama asked to come see him in chicago i didnt know why i turned out to be secretary of state which was very exciting and there goes it so much worse than they told her that before and indeed it was nearly jobs auto industry was on the brink of collapse all those jobs all the way down the supply chain and the president weve got problems around the world and we have big problems here at home to get this economy out of the ditch and thats why you dont deal with secretary of state issues and im gonna focus on the economy and thats what we did and thats what he did know the republicans want us to have a case of collective amnesia and forget it was therefore they put us in that big ditch so now we are going out there covered million jobs growth rate this last so were standing running again my husband or im gonna do what we gotta get wages going up again their hard work is paying for them and their families obviously we have to raise the minimum wage and poverty we have to do more than we gotta do more action incentivize profitsharing so when people work hard and their work helps reduce profits those profits are shared not just with workers actually how is my mission when it comes to me and i want to also see s really good jobs for people how we gonna do that no one of the ways youre gonna do i change my transition to clean energy jobs and the people you are out of all these weather related of this but we need to be pessimistic determined about some states are really already moving toward clean renewable energy and i was yes and they are already getting thirty percent of their electricity from wind i just came from massachusetts which is not known as a steady state like florida and they ranked number for the country and solar power im hoping to get sidetracked when it comes to win comes just solar it comes to advanced biofuels and the people who say well that might hurt the economy or the republican candidates when theyre asked about climate change you know what they say im not a scientist my response to that is actually hear what they have to say opportunity it shouldnt be seen as a dress to be seen as a way to lift our sights do what we should do jobs businesses make money doing it now except two big goals as i want to see a half a billion more solar panels and by the end of my second enough clean energy power every home in america cited by this challenge and i want everybody to think about what you can do when youre in your home and your business working at your city your state and at the national level something that your jobs i want to have whats called the infrastructure and way doing what we ought to do a chain and repair roads but not just roads bridges that are falling apart we had sewer lines gas pipelines we have a lot of work to do this country and its good work and ignoring you hear from you as day i was privileged to represent in the united states you know a lot of our infrastructure is a hundred and fifty years old some of the channels other things going on the ground their old exploding time to get ahead of it and i also believe that if we are serious about growing our economy and increasing incomes than we want to make sure women get equal pay you know thats right lets break it in every kiss and every workplace in america know and i get letters all the time women were really frustrated theyre helping to support their families or maybe there this their stories and thats what to do with how they can be treated fairly and equally to make this point this is a womans issue because women are disadvantaged but its a family issue and its economic issue people are trying to be more if we actually do what we should be doing anyway now the republicans are always whenever i talk about this there she goes as planned the gender advocating for equal pay for equal work is playing the gender card deal because that is the central focus of what i want to do as president everything else kind of adds up to the education for example i want to make sure we do what we must to improve elementary and secondary education i think the best way to begin is by actually listening to respecting teachers who are the ones with the kids all day you have the ideas they should be first in line and they will be around any help me figure out what we do that we will not as competitive education as we want to be and we dont have early childhood education five years my kids to be successful or not now look i have this amazing wonderful grandchild we gonna be enough with the reading in the talking in this we do it because we love to do it because we know it literally built eighty percent of your brain is for many age of every kid shot the same chance to be successful we do universal prekindergarten program and we need to start with kids will have the biggest challenges you have the biggest disadvantages obstacles so that every kid has a level playing field that ladder of opportunity you know i think every person should have the same right to his or her godgiven potential and i happen to be a challenge is you is universally opportunity is all i can to make sure our smallest our youngest citizens have a chance and then on the other end we are affordable and youre going to get all the chance to refinance your dad and its just not right refinance your mortgage payment why cant you answer student debt i dont federal government money education and it wont surprise you to know im a big fan of community colleges to do everything i can to make sure we implement president obamas plan to make community college now when it comes to help because its working million people are getting health care and young people get to stay on their parents policies until theyre which is a very big help to a lot of the families that i need to bring the cost out of pocket and prescription drugs percent last year so i had put forth a plan to bring them now but it was my plan was the very same day and i managed to raise the price of a pill to percent increase we can sustain this we handle on prescription drug costs and weve got make it possible for medicare to negotiate with drug companies to taxpayers you and i we pay for the nih we pay for some of the clinical trials conducted we pay for the fda which decides whether drug is safe and effective and then we pay the higher prices for those drives during the negotiating price if youre in europe and australia america maybe youre from northern new york i was your senator i used to go up to the border and see busloads of people crossing the border to buy the very same we can continue to pay for the drugs we developed we have got to rate this in a plan to do that let me say you think about the affordable care act is just stressing too many others dates refused to expand medicaid to cover more time looking here in order as many as people coverage and your manicure you are people without insurance means people who get preventive care emergency makes no sense that it would reconsider your governor and the republicans in tallahassee said no no no no families no fairness and to make matters worse because they said no refused to expand medicaid people are set to working people people people are disproportionately left out it makes no economic sense it makes no mistakes and expanded it they are actually see lower insurance rate increases and theyre not seeing as many emergency room visits and other expensive problems so im gonna let the republicans kill the affordable care act to repeal it certainly stand in their way but i want to improve it thats why a lot of pocket policy prescription drug three other issues that were having a caregiving crisis in this country is only going to get worse than people who need to share memories are taking care of their loved ones are some of you or somebody in your family have so little health care daycare help caregivers get the care they need to take care of their we had a substance abuse epidemic in america other prescription drugs and people are dying to veterans day a lot of them came back and they didnt get the care they need it but they got hit a bunch of pills they got hooked so our job has to be how to get more prevention or treatment or so people can get into recovery right now million people who are addicted only one can get any coverage so i think weve got to do more to have parity with mental health mental health is an expensive problem a lot of people end up in prison because they have health problems that are not treated in a self medicate using so these are expensive and hard braking problems but im convinced that we can tempt them together im also going to have to stand up for our fundamental rights or civil rights because the other side against marriage equality and against discrimination and for everybody and it can states that are trying to restrict and i will try to overturn citizens i will fight to get i believe its in the best interest of our criminal justice and to pull away because matter fight is just heartbreaking it is sickening to me another massacre people should not have to be a way to go to college and go to the movie study we cant stand up just tragic just need to pray for people we need to ask every time theres another massacre republicans in the nra is not the time to talk about guns and more than republicans keep refusing to protect our communities of american families it is wrong to make every politician whose them to look into the eyes of parents whose children have been murder and explain why they listen to the damn lobby is well aware im well aware that this is done in this country if you dont start by talking it out and we have had to many murders too many people who should have never gone in the first whatever their rage their their mental problems by killing other people i didnt work on this national i dont think they represent a majority of americans having an intense dedicated care politicians and we will vote against you on the other side and disgusting care about a lot of other issues about college affordability we are not seen minded voters care about this issue there are a lot of ways institution restriction my husband passed the brady bill eliminated assault weapons for were going to take the mom took them out of the nineties on again and i help you do that so we have a lot of work to do thats why were getting started here in florida and i want each and every one of you to be involved in this campaign because i do we have to have an agenda for change and then we have to reach as many people as we can to make the case change we want to see what has worked to take it further and not let the republicans rip away the progress with their out of date out of such ideas and turn where we have challenges around the world thats why i think my experience as secretary of state and they said are from new york is especially pertinent to what were gonna have to do to make sure we remain safe and secure with our values and in pursuit of our interest today to tell you what gets me up keeps me going out about my granddaughter not just what kind of everything we can to make it to be thats not enough people should become an adult world will be waiting granddaughter of my grandfather went to work in this crap they work hard to support his family but also because he wanted his better ways to college my dad became a small businessman is really small business but he worked hard this year i am generation thats whats supposed to happen in america whatever you might be i dont think its enough that my grandma owner will have opportunities and the granddaughter of former president has a chance to attention should also apply to the granddaughters affecting every other person in america every single day working to make sure every child and every person has the chance to win if you help me that is what we will do thank yougood afternoon my husband jackson and i raising three boys michael william jack since they were very little we taught them to be advocates for themselves those issues they believe in and those that may be on the fringe society not in other words were raising boys who we hope will be fighters for those things and people they believe in that is exactly the kinda person who belongs in the white house the jackson and i want to have a president for our boy your children your grandchildren and knows that do not have a voice to ensure right and vibrant future who will fight to create an economy for tomorrow who will fight to make our families and communities stronger who will fight to make sure each our nation is secure from the growing threat terrorism who will fight for campaign finance reform so that our government is on by it the and not my handful the wealthiest in this country the and selfishly as i when who will fight to help us rebuild our party here in iowa so are state can once again offering leaders like tom vilsack and tom harkin the go hillary you have proven yourself to be that fighter i know you will fight my voice and all my yearold nana kennedy passed away five years ago she had hoped she would live long enough to see a woman president she believed that present that woman would be you and she had the best political instincts anyone i know she was right it is going to be you the and because bad it is my deep honor introduce to you the next president the united states the care thank you for that introduction thank you for being committed to the right values fighting for them in the political arena in your home across this state and country i have to tell you i am thrilled to be here to see olive you it is a special treat to be here not only that day after i kicked off the form a part of my camp but to be here on flag day because after all we care deeply about the country we love and we cherish and political campaigns should be about what kind of future we can create together for ourselves most particularly our children and our grandchildren now over the past month ive been listening to what you here and ill have to say inc and coffee shops in community colleges in businesses ive heard you share worries about the economy still seems stack those top but ive also heard about your hopes for your familys and our country i met a single mom juggling a job in classes at community college while raising three kids she doesnt expect anything to come easy but she did ask me what more can be done so it isnt quite so hard for families like hers i believe the answer lies in the basic bargain america if you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead and when everybody does their part america gets ahead bargain inspired generations families including my own its what kept my grandfather going to work as a factory worker in the same lace mill in scranton pennsylvania every day for fifty years its what led my father to believe that if scram and say he could start a small business bringing drapery fabric in chicago and could provide us with the middle class life and he did and as much as our world has changed the structure of our economy and the shape our families and so much more bad basic bargain still holds the key to our prosperity here in iowa and across the country americans are working themselves back from economic crisis that exploded because timetested values were replaced by false promises you know what they were instead a min economy bill by every american for every american we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and band the rules their success with trickledown to everyone else and we know how that worked out so americans have made a new beginning working extra shifts taking second jobs postponing home repairs families figured out how they could make it work again and now people here across iowa are thinking about the future okay going to college starting at business youve always dreamed about buying a house finally be able to put more away for retirement so were standing again but were not yet running i said in my speech yesterday that both the two democratic presidents the last years one iraq obama the other my husband the show that it is possible to do better they both inherited the problems from their republican predecessors and they had day guess out of holes but the facts speak for themselves producing more jobs for more people creating more economic opportunity and prosperity and trying to build a strong foundation for what we do next but you know what you see you see corporations making record profits with ceos making record pay your paycheck have barely budged while many have you are working multiple jobs to make ends me you see the top hedge bond managers making more then all the kindergarten teachers in america come by and often paying a lower tax rate than those kindergarten teachers so you have to wonder when does my hard work pay off when does my family get ahead when i say now prosperity just be for ceos and hedge fund managers democracy cant just be four billionaires and corporations prosperity and democracy our part your basic bargain to you brought our country back now its time it your time to secure the gains and move ahead and you know what america can succeed unless you people ball races in educational levels every kind of america you can imagine stand and pledge allegiance to the swag they sing the national anthem at sporting events school assemblies its time everybody felt like they were included and that they had the same shank live up to their own potential im running for president to make our economy work for you and for every american the im not running for some americans but for all americans and we have come too far to see our progress ripped away now we cant go back to the top down economic policies that failed us before you know that old saying for me one shame on you will meet twice shame on me now there may be some new voices in the republican presidential wire but theyre all singing the same all song its a song called yesterday now i know when i said this yesterday you know the song all our troubles look as though theyre here to stay and we need a place to hide away they believe yesterday and your lucky i didnt try to sing you know but when they heard me and budget jumped up yesterday over well then and policies that yesterday rep trip for themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that would make income inequality worse now ask these candidates about climate change one of the defining threat our time and theyll say im not a scientist well then why dont they start listening to those who are edge wide top rules on wall street rather than reining in the banks that are still to risky courting future failures what they have a case math amnesia that was tried we saw what happened they want to take away health insurance from sixteen million americans without offering any credible alternative shame and blame women rather than respect our right to make our the the yea wanna put immigrants to work hard and pay taxes at risk deport deportation and they turned their backs im gay people who love each other the finally fundamentally favorite jack what it takes to build an inclusive economy it takes an inclusive society a village with a place for everyone my values and a lifetime experiences have given me a different vision for america i believe our success is it measured by how much the wealthiest americans have by how many children climb poverty how many startups and small businesses open and thrive how many young people go to college without drowning in dat the how many people find a good job in how many families get ahead and stay thats why you here give me the chance i will wage in four fights for you the first to make the economy work for everyday americans not just those at the time in the coming weeks out propose specific policies to reward businesses to invest longterm value rather than a quick buck because that leads to higher growth for the economy higher wages for workers and yes even bigger profit i will rewrite the tax code rewards hard work and investment here home not quick trades for stashing profits oversee im new incentives to companies that give their employees air share up profits that their heart i will work to on leash a new generation entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief cutting red tape and making it easier to get a small business loan there was one of the stories i heard across people who wanted to start a small business struggling to make it grow were saying i cant access to credit well the big guys can its time you did too i will restore america cuttingedge innovation science and research you know we are on the brink so many breakthroughs about disease it breaks my heart that because the congress has cut back on our funding for finding out what to do about alzheimers or autism so many other labs have been forced to close young scientists told im sorry just not important enough for us to continue funding you right now this is such a short term view how we can do better i will get those science labs open i will get those scientists back to work together we can make america into the clean energy superpower in the world youre already showing the way aaron with and an advanced biofuels we just need to organize our economy so that it in bass in the renewable a bio fuels the solar the win on a national scale and you know what there are millions uh jobs waiting for us if we dont create here at home i can guarantee you that chinese the germans and others will create them over there lets not hip hop until we have the cleanest most prosperous energy economy in the world as i roll out these policies i want you to understand where im coming from im gonna propose an infrastructure bank funded with bonds we need better roads we need better or port airport we need better bridges we need better broadband we need all of that and its a shame that were allowing our infrastructure to crumble before our eyes and its send a message that we dont want to send that were not going to be competitive in the future but its also important to remember whats your biggest asset our people and particularly our youngest i wanna make preschool and quality child care available to every child i wanna make sure we give our teachers respect they deserve sparking burning every child ill be giving you specifics about how i intend to make college affordable and to live that crushing burden obscured and how we will finally make lifelong learning available for everybody to gain or improve the skills they need and to set up more americans for success i wanna say a word about another issue theres a lot of discussion right now about the potential transpacific partnership trade deal i wanna tell you what i think needs to be in that agreement first let me start by saying no president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of american workers either with our trading partners or republicans on capitol hill then i would be my time eight years in the senate i voted for some trade agreement and i voted against others i think i have a pretty good idea what we can do to meet task i believe any trade agreement especially tpp must meet it he said number one protect american workers number two it needs to raise wages and create the jobs at home number three it needs to be in our national security interest ive been saying that for months heres what i think should happen now in order to get a deal that meets these high standards the president should listen to and work with his allies in congress starting with nancy pelosi who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best strongest deal possible and if we dont get there should be no deal now in fact i think this is the opportunity to speak out you know theyre the voices you heard them therefore the deal no matter whats in it and their the voices that are against the deal no matter whats in it i kinda fall in the group that says lets find out whats in it and lets make it as good as it can be and then lets make a decision and from my perspective the president actually has this amazing opportunity now you know how to negotiate so you go to the trading partners the people that have been involved in this negotiation go i miss you give me more i miss you meet the needs that have been laid out that my party in congress had on and spoken out about and made clear have to be in the deal were not gonna have a deal but we could have a deal if we made sure that we did everything possible to protect american workers to rage the wages of american workers to make sure that is in our national security interest and there are some specifics in there that could and should be changed so i am hoping thats what happens now lets take the womens internet and eliminate lets say if there is a way to get to an agreement that does do what ii expected to do it has to include trade adjustment authority to provide kinda protections for american workers that i am looking for but i am willing to try now to see whether you cant push to get rid of the objectionable parts to drive a harder bargain on sum up the other parts and to provide more transparency so that the american people can actually see what will be n a proposed final deal and so if i were in the white house that would thats what id be doing right now i would be trying to figure out whether there is a way to get a deal that does what it should do the american workers that people starting with leader pelosi can say you know what weve made some real changes here this might work or not but lets try and see whether theyre is this opportunity now we also have to recognize that if we dont do more to help american families we can have agreements from here to the moon and were still not gonna make it possible for most american families feel like theyre getting ahead and from my perspective i believe you should have the right turn paid sick days you should have the right to receive your work schedule with enough notice arrange childcare you should be able to look forward retirement with confidence and you should certainly be able to count on your health care being there without breaking the bank and way past time to and the outrageous so many women still earning less than men jogged this is in a womans issue this is a family issue every american family should feel like they belong and i will do everything to make sure that happens and here at home we do we do have to be aware that you know there are threats in the world i think theyre far more opportunities lets admit there are threats our brave men and women come home from war finish their service i will do everything i can to see that they get not just our thanks but the care and benefits theyve earned when i was in the senate when i was in the senate i talked to my constituents in new york first things i heard our national guard troops didnt get access to the same health care benefits but they were being called more and more so i worked across the aisle to make sure they did and i have a lot respect for what are service members an arbiter have done for us and its not enough just to give a speech we gotta do much more ive also stood up to adversaries like you attack me publicly forward standing up to him which i took badge of honor the and i know we have to work more closely with our allies and partners around the world to build trying to save secure prosperous world im looking for that means our nato partners in europe means our treaty allies in asia it means our friends right here in latin america it means israel and the middle east we have to work more closely to make sure that they and we are on the same page united states cant do this alone we shouldnt do it alone we have to lead the world because the alternative us leading the world is a vacuum there will be filled by some pretty dangerous characters so we do have to leave the world but we need to lead by pulling everybody together being in the same and finally the fourth fight under girds so much what i want to achieve in the other three an is in order to be strong in the world we have to be strong home thats why we have to reform our government and revitalize our democracy works for everybody stop endless secret unaccountable money that is distorting our elections corrupting our political process running out hi i would appoint justices to the supreme court who would protect every citizens right to both rather than every corporation right if necessary i will support a constitutional amendment to undo the supreme courts decision in the citizens united but not not at this will work unless people like you and millions and millions more across our country turn out and vote i wanna make easier for every citizen to about we need universal automatic registration win a young american turns a team so that they are signed up i gave a speech already giving notice to the republicans i will fight them on their efforts to disempowered and disenfranchised young people poor people people with disabilities and people of color no matter what state theyre and the what heart democracy are they afraid up its time to hold them accountable now we americans may differ and bicker and stumble and fall thats kind of been our dna but we are at our best when we pick each other up when we have each others back and like any family our american family is strongest when we shares we have in common and fight back against those who would drive us apart from my first trip as secretary of state to asia in february to my very last people all over the world ask me you and present work together after you fought so hard against each other in that campaign it was understandable question considering that in many places if you lose an election you could be exiled in prison or even killed not hired a secretary stay and the first time i was asked this i was on a tv show the morning tv show in jakarta indonesia and i got asked the question unlike any tv show ever been on before since dancing and singing i was worried there and asked me to sing my favorite songs which you know i do love to sing but nobody left well ten stop then all of a sudden i get asked this question and you know the tv cameras are going going right now i have like a nanosecond or what im gonna say question no really important question because its a new democracy in many places in the world people put their family their clan try their race their sec for their country and so i was being how you do it in america and i said youre right really hard campaign against each other he won i lost when he asked me to sir i accepted for the same reason we both love our country thats how thats how we do it in america and with that same spirit together we can win these we can build an economy where hard work is rewarded in fact we will we can strengthen our families in fact we will we can defend our country and increase our opportunities around the world in fact we will and we can renew the promise of our democracy and we well now i know this is not going to be easy ive been around awhile case you havent heard anybody say that just thought id tell you and i know as well anyone how hard this job is ive seen it up close and personal all our presidents come into office looking so vigorous and then we watch their hair rare gray hair well you wont see my hair turned white and why hi ive been telling us for years and i may not be candidate in this race but with your help i will be youngest woman president the i i hope you will give me that chance i have spent my life fighting for children families in our country im not stopping now you know ive been called many things by many people quitter is not one of them i have to say like so much else in my life i got that from my mother she taught me that everybody needs a chance and champion she knew what it was like not have either one talked a lot about her since we lost her because i realized how much i old to her not just because she was my mom and did a great job for me because she was such credible example courage resilience only parry parent here at the age of she was out around working as a housemaid i didnt know any that when i was a little girl news you know we pick cherries backyard be played in she media learn how to play tennis you tried to teach so one with more success than the other but years later when i was old enough to understand i asked her what kept you going you know her answer was something very simple kindness from someone who believed she mattered firstgrade teacher she had nothing to eat at lunch without embarrassing her brought extra share the woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work was done that was a bargain she left to accept because people believed in her at critical moments she believed in me because her i believe in the potential every american i have met hundreds of thousands maybe millions of americans over the course very blessed life looked in the guys so many people little kids thrust into foster care being treated were lifethreatening diseases dads who just lost job and dont know theyre gonna go home tell their family moms who are single doing the best they can to keep body and soul part look in those and i believe so much that when you succeed america sexy and theres a role important role reticle for our government to play we all believe that america has our back when we do our best we need a little help itll be there but theres also a huge role for everybody else to play too want us to start looking each other fellow human beings fellow american want us to figure out how through our own families houses of worship our own businesses our own communities we can reach out to those in need we can be smart and compassionate at the same time i want you to join me in this after course i want you to help me bill this campaign and to make it your own want to talk to your family your friends your neighbors i want you to text join goin in to go to hillary clinton dot common sign up to make calls and knock on doors but more than that want you to feel this campaign is not about me its about all of us and its about the promise up this country which is so unique human history we can be more open more generous more respectful each other it really it it upsets me when i hear some what said in our political debates right now but more than that really its my heart wonder you know they not go hear the same lessons i did in sunday school did they not seeing the same him did they not have teachers who said you know better nor worse than anybody else they never hear there but for the grace of god go i where did this meanspiritedness come from we are such a blessed nation we have so many more opportunities even now with all of our challenges anybody in human history has ever had and so for me this is about not only waging a campaign and winning an election but it is about what we do together to build an america where if you do your part you reap the rewards where we dont leave anyone out or behind where we remember that there a lot little boys and girls like my mom who got that extra help which most needed im actually confident and optimistic that this campaign can lay the foundation for us doing that with and for each other again and yes we will have in america where a father can tell his daughter you can be anything you wanna be even president up the united states the theive never been to a revival quite like this one tell you what especially a revival lifting up lawyers faster and faster you know i have to say to president crime lawyer business doesnt work out for you i imagine theres a church or jus that might call you to that pub instead of to the bar this is the day the lord has made honestly wow let us rejoice and be glad in it and i have to thank all of you for the great honor of participating in this anniversary tribute what a wonderful idea attorney great as so many of your ideas have been over the years i listened very carefully as several speakers pointed out that it would be more than appropriate for attorney gray to receive a certain presidential medal of freedom ill tell you ive already written the president telling him i think thats a good idea and ive already got the congresswoman to a brain that when she goes to the christmas party at the white house shes gonna raise that not just with the president but importantly with mrs obama is such an honor to be here and i want to thank everyone for this invitation and i particularly want to recognize the few people who are with us starting with your congresswoman whom ive had the great privilege of getting to know and working with and looking forward to be a partner with her i want to acknowledge mayor strange thank you for having us here in your city and chairman dean of the montgomery county commission thank you mayor ford tuskegee thank you so much i also want to thank reverend handy for opening up this historic church to us today and i had a chance to visit with reverend and missus handy and indeed he was called to this church and i am looking forward to working to support the kind of mentoring and outreach programs that he is putting in place here we need more of that for more of our children and i brown could be with us today those of us who know of her career and her rise first through the nba than through the aba really hold her in such high esteem and i think you for your highlighting the many women in the civil rights movement particularly the lawyers because has been said my first job out of law school was for the childrens defense fund for marion wright edelman she was someone who i heard about when i was in law school saw one day on the bulletin board there used to be such things in the preinternet world called bulletin boards i saw where she was going to be speaking at yale law school where she graduated and where i was a student and i went over to hear her speak and i was just so impressed heres first africanamerican woman to pass the mississippi bar working on behalf of civil rights but focusing on the needs of children which to me is the really overwhelming challenge that we face today i listened to her and then she finished i went up to her and i said to her i said i id like to come work for you this summer she said well thats thats fine but i cant pay you and i said well i have to get a job because im putting myself through law school and i said if i can figure out how to get paid job she said well thats an offer i certainly wont refuse so i applied for and got a law student civilrights research council grant it enabled me to go to work that summer and then when i graduated i went to work full time later chaired the board of the childrens defense fund and to this day i count myself very lucky having seen that little notice on the bulletin board all those years ago and i especially am honored to be with the reverend bernice king someone whos moral clarity and call to action is certainly rooted in her fathers work but is uniquely her own her voice is one that deserves the closest attention and i am grateful she is here with us you know when i think about a lot of the great names that we heard today i am always impressed and frankly a little humbled no attorney gray is a distinguished man but he was a very young man when he took on these cases it is easy now in retrospect to somehow assume that the results were foreordained at the time to end segregation and oppression and in equality before the law was drawing to a close but i dont think we should never assume that it took the courage of so many and among the most courageous where the lawyers who took on the challenges in the courts and in the streets another person i had the great privilege of working with was jon dore who argued pivotal voting rights cases while serving in the department of justice and memorably had to step in between police and protesters to stop a bloodbath in jackson in after the murder of medgar evers i remember asking john doerr once as i was a very young lawyer at the time of this question afraid of course i was he said but i was representing the law i was representing we dont stand for that in the worst of times we live with ourselves i think about louis stokes we just lost he was fighting stopandfrisk back in the s and elaine jones a dear friend who defended death row inmates and help get the death penalty abolished in states as a lawyer with the n double acp legal defense fund i think of judges like frank johnson here in alabama who took his seat on the bench just a few weeks before rosa parks was arrested and struck down the montgomery bus segregation law as unconstitutional then did the same for parks and restaurants restrooms libraries airports and the alabama state police or his counterpart in the louisiana judge skelly right who overturned dozens of segregation laws there and before brown ordered ellis you to enroll black students these juris like many of the lawyers who were taking these cases endured death threats and cross burnings they were told by many of their neighbors down the street and brands they had known since childhood who would turn their backs but they didnt back down because they believed in the constitution in the rule of law and they knew that segregation was aid torsion of justice not an expression of it they also knew that sometimes lawmakers get it wrong and when that happens its up to lawyers and judges to make it right thats what many lawyers felt then its what many lawyers feel now our work isnt finished we do have to pay it forward there are still in justices perpetrated every day across our country sometimes in spite of the law sometimes unfortunately in keeping with it there are still too many americans especially too many africanamericans whose experience of the justice system is not what it should be there are still too many ways in which our laws and our policies fall short of our ideals so even as we celebrate all that our country has achieved in the past years we must in keeping with the legacy of those who have gone before look to the future and the work that is left to do we must reform our criminal justice system it can be an all too often is stacked against those with the least power there is something profoundly wrong when africanamerican men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing as a white man there is something profoundly wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes right now an estimated million black men are missing from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death and too many black families mourn the loss of a child ive met with too many mothers who have lost their children lost to senseless incomprehensible violence my heart breaks for them many of these women are doing something quite remarkable they are turning their grief into a powerful call to action for our nation we cant go on like this weve got to change we must strengthen the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve in too many parts of america today that trust has broken down lets remember that everyone benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law and as we work to deliver real reforms that can be felt in our communities lot of good work to build on across the country many police officers are out there every day inspiring trust and confidence honorably doing their duty putting themselves on the line to save lives and many police departments are deploying creative and effective strategies demonstrating how we can protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force we need to learn from those examples build on what works chart a new course in how we approach punishment and prison united states has less than five percent of the worlds population but almost of the worlds total prison population and our country has nearly one third of all the worlds women prisoners the numbers of people in prison are much higher than they were thirty or forty years ago even though crime rates are much lower end of the more than two million americans incarcerated right now a significant percentage are nonviolent offenders people held for violating parole or minor drug crimes or who are simply awaiting trial in backlogged courts keeping them behind bars does little to reduce crime but it does a lot to tear apart families and communities its time to change our approach and end the era of mass incarceration in america and we must do more to address the epidemic of gun violence that is plaguing our country i consider this a national emergency the vast majority of americans including the vast majority of gun owners support commonsense steps to reduce gun violence like comprehensive background checks and closing the loopholes that let guns fall into the wrong hands but even after what weve seen in paris and in other places congress wont even bring up a bill that will prohibit anyone on the nofly list from buying a gun think about it seems reasonable to assume if you are too dangerous to fly in america you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america congress gave the gun industry something that was a mistake plain and simple that needs to be reversed and yes we must strengthen that most fundamental citizenship right the right to vote i thought wed solve their problem thanks to many of the lawyers we are honouring today but unfortunately there is mischief of what and some people are just determined to do what they can to keep other americans from voting now i know is i was here at joe reads invitation a few weeks ago about the dispute thats going on in alabama where there is a strict new voter id e law in effect and then a lot of the dmv offices in every single county where africanamericans make up more than percent of registered voters were closed now that would make getting drivers licenses and personalized you cards much harder which in turn would make voting much harder to the right to vote is so fundamental to our democracy but its also about peoples dignity the right to stand up and say i am a citizen i am an american my voice and my vote count no matter who you are or where you come from what you look like or how much money you have that means something as ben was saying with that powerful quote from justice marshall before the law we are all to be equal and in the voting booth we are all to be equal as well and that cannot and must not be taken away and finally finally we must be honest about the larger and deeper inequalities that continue to exist across our country you cant credibly talk about reforming our criminal justice system and strengthening our democracy without also talking about increasing economic opportunity improving education giving more support to working families our children deserve the best start in life and we have to do more to make that possible i do have this most wonderful amazing fourteenmonthold granddaughter and i listened carefully to been talking about brooklyn and ive got no doubt that he and his wife were gonna do everything it takes to make sure shes prepared to pursue her dreams but i want that for every child and you cannot cannot credibly pledged to do your part to make our country more just with also being willing to take a look at yourself at our own lives our own preconceptions we each need to do the hard work of rebuilding our bonds with one another this isnt just about strengthening ties between police and citizens although that is very important its about strengthening ties across society between and among neighbors colleagues even people with whom we profoundly disagree its about how we treat each other what we value together this is so fundamental to who we are as a nation and everything we could hope to achieve and you know those of us who serve in politics or who want to lead our country have a special responsibility to bring americans together not pull us apart and may be unusual hearing presidential candidates say we need more love and kindness but that is exactly what we need right now after the first day of the bus boycott sixty years ago that evening thousands of people are jammed in the streets inside the church when dr martin luther king jrs depth to the pulpit to go back and read what he said that night of course he spoke about roses integrity about citizenship about fairness under the law and then he started talking about love parts of the christian faith and there is another side called justice and i love this especially as a recovering lawyer justice is really love in calculation justice is love correcting that which would work against love standing beside love is always justice decades after her place in history was secured rosa parks came to washington to sit with me at the state of the union she looks beautiful and i jul colored dress with her head crowned in a long braids just like in her booking photos the day she was arrested the entire congress rose to give her a long standing ovation to see all of our nations leaders democrats and republicans alike united in their esteem for her she was once the focal point of perhaps the most divisive issue of our time that was a powerful indicator of how far we had come rosa hadnt changed much she was the same lovely dignified determined person she always was that america had changed its always struck me how depending on the way you look at it rosa parks either did something tremendous or something rather humble on the one hand she helped ignite a social movement that sought to finish the work of the civil war and redeem the promise of the th th and th amendments and the other hand she finished her shift at the montgomery fair department store took a regular bus home where she and other africanamericans always sad and when the bus driver ordered her to move she quietly so quietly if the bus were still running no one could have heard her above the engine noise said no thats how often gets made doesnt it and an ordinary day by seemingly ordinary people doing something extraordinary its only when we look back that we realize thats the day when everything began to change thats how it was with december st i suspect rosa parks would be the first to say that what happened sixty years ago today and everything that followed was the result of countless acts of courage and sacrifice by people from many walks of life and im sure she would also attorney gray acknowledged that critical role that attorneys played as we look forward i hope we keep in mind what we can do days like this began to make a difference maybe only with a few people maybe though to start ripples that will change history is no doubt in my mind that the power of our constitution of the rule of law and the courage of those who fight to uphold it is one of the great assets united states of america has let us go forth today challenged to do our part to make sure that this generation will see the work of justice and equality as well as love and kindness i look forward to being your partner in the years ahead thank you all very muchand i want to or not only a lasting her morning g announcement youre here who are women and men and children and families across new hampshire and america believe that working together you can make a real difference can make it out work opportunity and prosperity for our wedding we slide backward and all the hard work weve done over the last years particularly last sixandahalf years away we have come from college will also provide health care to see president im alone could be where you turn when a loved one whos battling addiction or mental yes searching for answers to problems because i travel the country people come in and talk to me about their lives you know its a very serious actually listen to the time to give people a chance to talk to you as opposed to talking job classes at community college for raising three kids alone shes doing what you have to do to give herself and her children a better wife and she does not expect any knowledge about going to college top of everything else take care of her mother could be done other candidates may be out there early insults at everyone talking about one whos to blame every single day when im president and these are not new for me you know i have to help others joined the fight im happy to have people over some of these problems my first job was with the childrens defense fund work my entire even for people who have those odd care about because when women can participate in the workforce our economy grows and your family and by the way women policies workers are women raising the minimum wage sharon the prophetess like market basket not just the shower whatever it takes to advance theyre out of touch the last presidential debate they faced each other about everything theyre still talking about topped out of touch policies and they also you how their ideas just not interested in how that word about or more trickle down havent worked no one hardly has become the party talk about these matters and organized potential and yes father and say his daughterwow this is a great way to start my day day and im delighted to be here with you i wanna thank mark for not only the introduction but all at his work over the years i have been a fan up marks since he was mayor new orleans he did great work there and hes doing great work at the national urban league cell thank you mark and you know were all thinking as i hope we do every year about new orleans as we near the th anniversary of katrina something like that should never be allowed it to happen in the united states america again so we have to keep learning the lessons and re pledging our commitment i thank everyone for welcoming me here today i want to that give a shout out to your national chairman of the board michael night or also backstage i saw longtime friend mind congressman alcee hastings and alexis herman who served in my husbands administration and tony west to served in president obamas administration theres a a veritable hall of fame here for this event and i can never come to a national urban league gathering without mentioning my lifelong friend vernon jordan he may not be here today but hes with us in spirit because and his deep love and commitment to this organization its also close to my heart over the years ive gotten the chance to work with you learn from you ive poured over your state of black america reports ive spoken at your conferences but most importantly ive seen how you change peoples lives the theme at this conference saving our cities education jobs and justice speaks to the important work that youve been doing for decades i know that you help black entrepreneurs get startup capital i know you help people find jobs i know you give families financial counseling so they can achieve their dreams a buying a home or sending their kids to college and you make sure parents have the tools to take care at their kids health thats the kind daytoday commitment that makes such a difference as you help prepare young people for college and work in a world that can sometimes make them feel that theyre not very important you make sure they know just how precious and powerful they really are this by to work has been my work to my first job out of law school wasnt at some big law firm it was with the childrens defense fund started by marion wright edelman that for summer after i graduated i went door to door for kids shut out of school and denied the education they deserve i also began a lifelong concern by working with cdf to try to figure out what we did with kids caught up in the juvenile and adult prison systems as first lady i helped create the childrens health insurance program you were an ally in doing that as senator i champion small businesses owned by women and people of color because thats where a lot of the jobs in america come from i thought to raise the minimum wage because no one who works hard in america ship to raise their kids in poverty these issues your issues are deeply personal to me so im here early on this morning first and foremost to say thank you but im also here to talk about the future because the work you have been doing is more important than ever and im going to keep doing network right alongside you now i would love nothing more then to stay and have a conversation for hours going into depth about ever singleissue that we are worried about but you have a full slate of speakers that will follow me so let me make three points about the work we need to do together first the opportunity gap that america is facing is not just about economic in a quality it is about racial in a quality now that may seem obvious to you but it bears underscoring because some uh the evidence that backs it up would come as a shock too many americans like how africanamericans are nearly three times as likely as whites to be denied a mortgage or how in the median well for white families was more than one hundred and thirtyfour thousand dollars but for africanamerican families it was just eleven thousand dollars a lot of people dont realize that our schools are more segregated today than they were in nineteen or even that africanamericans are sentenced to longer prison terms than white people for the same crimes or that political operatives are trying every trick in the book to prevent africanamericans from voting and listen to this one because as somebody who started with the childrens defense fund and you now is the proud and delighted grandmother a monthold granddaughter africanamerican children are percent more likely to die from asthma and white kids now i studied and advocated introduce legislation to close health disparities i knew i knew how severe they were but five hundred percent so all this points to an on avoidable conclusion race race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in america and who gets left behind and yes wall thats partly a legacy of discrimination that stretches back to the start our nation it is also because it discrimination that is still on going im not saying anything you dont already know you understand this better than i do better than anyone but i wanna say it anyway because im planning to be president and anyone who seeks that office has a responsibility to say it and more than that to grapple with the systemic inequities that so many american space anyone who asks for your boat should tried their hardest to see things as they actually are not just as we want them to be so i want you to know i see it and i could hear you and the racial disparities you work hard every day to overcome goal against everything i believe in and everything i want to help america achieve the second point is this this is not just about statistics as damning as they can be this is about americans doing some soulsearching and holding ourselves to account this is about all of us looking into examining our assumptions and fears and asking ourselves what more can i do in my life to counter hate and injustice how can i make our country a better fairer place let me be clear i think all of us need to do that kinda introspection but those of us who have not experienced systemic racial inequities we have an extra obligation we need to do a better job listening when people talk about the scene and unseen barriers they face every day we need to practice humility rather than assume that our experiences are everyones experiences and yes we need to try as best we can to walk in one anothers shoes to imagine what it would be like to sit our son down and have that talk or if people followed us around stores or locked their car doors when we walked past that empathy thats what makes it possible for people from every background every race every religion to come together as one nation thats the kinda generosity of spirit that makes a country like america endure and given what weve seen and experience over the last two years this is an urgent call for people to search their own hearts and mines heres my third point weve arrived at a moment when all these challenges are in sharp relief and we have to seize it too many times now americans have come together in shock and or to process a violent senseless tragedy like trayvon martin shot to death not in some empty desolate street somewhere but in a gated community wasnt stranger yet family there worse and herbal and college educated young woman who knew her rights who didnt do anything wrong but still ended up dying in a jail cell together weve mourned to mir rice sent eric garner walter scott and freddie gray and most recently sham two bombs these names are emblazoned on our hearts weve seen their faces weve heard their grieving families weve seen a massacre in charleston and black churches set on fire twoday but thankfully tragedy is not all we have seen yes the confederate battle flag came down finally in south carolina families in the charleston victims reached out with extraordinary grace to the man who killed their loved ones and president obama delivered a eulogy that sounded as though it had come straight from angels ending with amazing race young people have taken to the streets dignified and determined urging us to affirm the basic fact that black lives matter and because uh people all across this country sharing their stories with courage and strength a growing number of americans are realizing but many are you have been saying for a long time we cant go on like this we are better in this things must change now its up to us to build on that momentum and we all have to do our part but those of us we strive to lead have a special responsibility im very pleased that many presidential candidates will be here today to address you it is a signal that the work youve been doing laboring in the vineyards for decades is getting the political attention it deserves but the real test have a candidates commitment its not whether we come to speak at your national conference as important as that is its whether were still around after the cameras are gone and the bolts are pounded its whether our positions live up to our rhetoric and too often we see a mismatch between what some candidates say in venues like this and what they actually do when theyre elected i dont think you can credibly say that everyone has the right to rise and then say youre for phasing out medicare or for repealing obamacare people cant rise if they cant afford health care they cant rise at the minimum wage is too low to live on they cant rise up there governor makes it harder for them to get a college education and you cannot seriously talk about the right to rise and support laws that deny the right tugboat the so yes what people say matters but what they do matters more americans especially today deserved leaders who will face inequity race and justice issues and all their complexity headon who want just conceded that there are barriers holding people back who will do instead what it takes to chair those barriers down once and for all i will never stop working on issues have a quality and opportunity race and justice that is a promise ive done it my entire adult life i will always be in your corner because issues like these they are why im running for president they are why i got involved in public service in the first place to tear down the barriers that hold people back from developing their talents and achieving their dreams im asking you to hold me accountable to hold all of us accountable because the work that youre doing must lead to action and you deserve leaders who not only get that but who will work hard every day to make our country a better place to make it live up to its potential and to provide the opportunities for every single child in this country to live up to his or her godgiven potential yes i do have this tenmonthold grandchild now and i gotta tell you those have you already have reaches incredible transformational point in your lives understand this there is nothing like it to focus you on the present you know when bill and i are with charlotte doing our best to babysit phones are off the tv is off which is focused on this miracle of life and where the kinda grandparents ill confess that you know when she learns to clap your hands we give her a standing ovation but you see its not just about our granddaughter isnt we of course will do everything we can to make sure she has all the opportunities she should as a citizen love this country as a child god as a person who has the right to go as far as her hard work and talent will take ur thats not enough i dont want that just for my granddaughter im the granddaughter of a factory worker who work from the time he was a teenager to the timely retired in a scranton lee smells i ate knoll how blessed ive been and opportunities that i had that others with just as much talent did not sell let us tear down the barriers said no matter whose child you are or grandchild you are you too will have the same chance im proud to be your ally im committed to being your partner i will keep fighting right alongside you today and always to make the united states of america a country where all men and women all boys and girls are treated as they deserve to be as equals i know we can do this i know the path ahead is not easy but im absolutely convinced that we will once again join hands and make a difference for those young people will not only need a path but need the love and embrace have a grateful nation for the contributions they each will make to a better future for us all thank you and god bless you the ladies and gentlemen i secretary hillary rodham clinton ive got job three short questions first we r as a part of this process going to be i sharing with you a questionnaire which ask for your positions on issues contained in the st century ill agenda for jobs and freedom and i want to know if you can commit to respond to that questionnaire we will make it public yes second i like question is we have within the urban league movement an exciting generation up new new generation leaders a who are coming of age could you talk to them a little bit about the role they would play they you you plan for them to play both in your campaign but also in the issues and in your administration some people refer to them as the millennials their part of our young professionals some heavy merges leaders of our affiliates but they are represented in large number here could you talk to them for me id be happy to mark and and let me just make a couple quick points because i think this is by the most important questions you or anybody could ask on i have been so blessed over the years to have had a lot have wonderful people working for me i and now i have the next generation the millennials the the young activists who themselves have been successful and i see a difference between this generation and maybe some prior generations where for africanamericans for women for others who felt like they had to struggle to be successful there was a sense that thank goodness i made it and im gonna do the best i can in my life i will make contributions but the days of activism are behind me this new generation is in a very important way combining personal success with continuing act as a minivan and rotation and i think we need that i not only welcome it i hope that we can together harness it because like i said about my granddaughter it is not enough that some of us are successful it is not enough when we see growing inequality economic and racial and social therefore i in list and ask for the help up this active committed young generation you know thats theres a great old saying what you to do it what are you to do well you can comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable that is part of your role and even though i sometimes may be on the receiving end thats okay because as i said in my remarks i want you to hold me accountable and i particularly want to be held accountable by young people who know the kinda future they want to help us create thank you very much in my up final question in the discussion around income inequality the racial wealth gap one part the conversation thats been missing and not really address i is the role of small businesses africanamerican on businesses many of them face frozen credit markets difficulty in building their business what would you say to the archer print yours about how you would address those concerns because they are indeed job creators many of them a womenowned businesses we serve twelve thousand small businesses across the nation about seventy percent of them are women own and they are so crucial to closing the racial wealth gap how would you address their concerns omark we could be here all day but let me quickly say i wanna be the small business president my dad was a small businessman and i saw how hard he worked and how he provided a good middleclass life for my family and marcus absolutely right on sixty percent have the net jobs created in america are created by small businesses but right now we have tax burdens regulatory burdens licensing burdens and credit barriers that are preventing both the starting a small businesses and their growth and expansion and it is particularly a problem for people of color and women and women of color especially sell part of what i wanna do nm started to talk about this all across the country is to really n on tearing down those barriers and one of the problems as mark said is frozen credit lack of credit for years i have worked on how you get more credit are too small businesses and particularly underserved areas i helped to start a development bank in arkansas which is still operating and still funding a lot a small businesses somebody here from arkansas thank you i want to take that model across the country i want to expand the small business administration i want to make sure that we have online lending that is a specially attuned to the needs a small business so i have a hall a whole small business agenda because this is one of the keys to not only creating well and creating jobs but getting our economy back moving as quickly and fast as it can to get back to where we were before the big crash now theres a lot more to talk about just two quick points cuz i im i dont wanna overstay my welcome but two quick points in my economic plans i talk about strong growth fair growth and longterm growth we cannot have any of that unless we do more to get more women into the workforce and have them paid fairly and take into account their particular challenges and secondly we have to get of the load of student debt because that is stopping a lot of young people from starting best essay says and so this it this is about the whole economy but in particular what do we need to do to clear the way for small businesses to start and grow and im gonna be the small business president i secretary hillary rodham clinton ladies in general thank you for being a carefullyhere with all of you did we ever gonna be the reason is because we were actually a president should be doing to make sure you need to make the most out of your life and i will let people finally got a chance to compete democrats to the republic we came out pretty well have you here in this absolutely beautiful it is a great pleasure to look out and see so many of you can be able to making sure that you and then we were just get rid of them did you hear from the other side starting with a sacked country does better when we have a democrat in the white house think its important just to wind down thanks in your head so when youre talking with some ear open minded independent friends or youre talking to republicans you can tell them that this is not just me saying it is a line of an intense it we have a democrat in the white house and even the stock market is higher but when you have a republican and the way you are likely to have a recession that the republicans you are running for president inc wanna go back and do what didnt work before i think they want to so many forget about the great recession which hit this state really hard you know in we were losing jobs and we ended up losing nine million jobs nine million people in this country lost their jobs lost their homes to that election just about a week after i got a call from them presidentelect obama yes becomes cnn chicago and i didnt know why turns out he wanted me to be secretary of state which i was very honored to be asked to do he said could fall into the great depression and they could hand they do not think president obama gets the credit he deserves for saving our economy crisis industry administration had been ignoring the affordable care eighty million americans see you would think with a record like that the republicans might change their approach in only the same things that ended us in the ditch in the first place taxes on the wealthy corporations thats basically all they say about the economy sucks i have a different approach and im pretty proud of the economic record my husband hand at the end of eight years of his presidency yeah we had three million new jobs and incomes went for everybody not just the top people everybody because we had an economy that was working for everybody and unfortunately not all changed when the republicans came back into the white house you know what happened and so crazy obama had to dig a ditch where i dont were standing were not yet running to do what will work to put more people to work and to raise wages again because they really round when three hundred times the typical worker makes i dont think anybody that were going to be able to get wages rising again unless we have a government with a president who actually cares about making sure our hardworking people see that friends your labor so heres what were gonna do were gonna start by creating more jobs by investing in people who are maintained and bridges airports were gonna read were gonna expand broadband we had been shaped can still rock band instead of so many other countries danced in science and research which will give you one example you know republicans dont wanna spend money on anything they actually helps people and they dont have my best in the future well we invested billion dollars in something called the human genome project twenty years ago i remember being in the white house today that my husband announced it been completed so what does that mean it means were going to be able to cure diseases and maybe start conditions once we understand what places now heres the economic point i wanna make million dollar investment of your tax money and mine nearly a trillion dollars has been generating new discoveries new businesses new jobs for the future were dead body in the world we need to be making them smile gonna make us richer and weve got that gave way and he gained a lot of difference in the economy create millions of new jobs new businesses and we take climate change seriously dont we go running for president who every time you ask them what about climate change they say something like i dont know im not a scientist well theres a very easy way to stop that ones here at the university they could tell you whats going on its important that we take this seriously not only because it is going to affect and why everyone of us alive but most importantly our children and grandchildren because if we do this right we can create millions of new jobs and businesses you know every year harry reid has a big conference about clean energy here in nevada has spoken at my husband spoken at it why he do that because he wants people to understand the economic opportunities that are available you know it is possible if we invest in wind and solar advanced biofuels geothermal you name it we can not only began to reverse the effects of climate change but we can begin to build a totally different way you here in the band are doing just that big bang theory you been investing in more solar in the town i stated before the debate on the window and door panels driving around today dont get a lot of places with solar panels well im setting some big goals for my presidency by the end of my first term i want us to have employed a half more solar panels to be installed acquired by the end of my second i want to generate enough clean renewable energy every home is the program with you dont worry about jobs going overseas while we do infrastructure at home and we dont clean energy jobs have to be done right here in the united states of america now as you change the tax system im sick and tired of operations getting big tax loopholes and all the rest in it to ship jobs out of america we need to take away tax breaks from corporations and use that money to rebuild our economy right here at home we need to do whatever we can to raise wages starting by raising the minimum wage which i know there are people who work in the minimum wage here right now minimum wage an hour is a disgrace who works full time left and poverty at the end of their working week so we are going to raise the minimum wage it has ever been to where it was in because dazed and weve been on a downward slope and were still going to do more to invest in apprenticeship programs in job training programs those at the international union of painters and allied trades today looking at how they train when theyre young apprentice impressed i know we could train tens and hundreds of thousands of people to do the job that clean energy and infrastructure building require now tell you think itll raise wages and itll raise wages across the board in america and that is to make sure women equal pay for equal and i want people are losing money because i met a young man last week in new hampshire came up to me to tell you i am thank you why you cannot tell you my first job he was years old he told me he got hired to be a cashier in a store near where you live kinda got the job because his mom had been working there for four years and she was doing the same job as a cashier he was really the first real job you go to work and he came back to his first paycheck showed his mom she noticed something her son was making a dollar more an hour after one week then she was making after four years now jane that story because this young man had no reason to make it up to tell me why it was for me said he could never thought about it for my mom really hard she was raised me she should be paid the same as any men including her year old son equal pay is an issue b is not just a womens issue its a family issue facing economic issue there will be more money in the economy when women are paying for themselves and for their families and we also need to look at how hard it is to balance family and work you know a lot of young parents struggle with that i think we should join the rest of the advanced world and had paid leave so that when you have a new baby way you have a sick relative you dont lose your job but you also dont lose your pay for a period of time responsible doing this just did paid sick days in their states are doing it and it hasnt affected the way that the republicans say it will for employment so weve got to take a hard look about families like today know what they were like years ago what they like today and how do we help them do the most important job which is taking care of each other when they also do their job making a living i think its really important that the tax system be changed to the wealthy pay more than theyre paying right now i dont think its right here contain a lower tax rate than a teacher i just dont think thats right i agree with warren warren buffetts every million years you have to pay at least against raghu might not paying companies are paying anything so part of the job that i will take on as your president is to get the wealthy to pay more in the middle plans a tax cut it is working hard and doing the best you can and facing the pressures you think a chance to be able to make ends meet your hands and going up the price of everything else and acting dance exactly what we need to do seem to forget it what makes america great and what makes our economy strong is the middle class to middle class who built this country is the middle class that does bugs that it has to get up every day take care of their families and their jobs and i think its time we start rebuilding the medical and giving you that tools that you need to make the most out of your own answer in the economy and that is to get comprehensive immigration really dont like what the republicans are saying about it we are a nation of immigrants we were built by immigrants every one of us we go back grandparents greatgrandparents we have somebody came to this country and are we glad they did and that we have the benefit of their hard work my grandfather came to this country is just a little boy he was a factory worker he worked really hard and ask for much of a good thing i those standards in those days because of his hard work but he wanted to get to have a better chance and sons went to college and my dad became a small businessman after he served in the navy during world war two and now im here asking you to vote for me for president thats three generations you my grandfather to my father jimmy in tonight we get through this crowd and we could have a thousand stories like that immigration is who we are and look around us and i think the republicans are doing great damage to our nation made herein so in their attacks such as your president i was certainly work hard for comprehensive immigration reform but i love so defend the executive orders of president obama and i know i know weve got some doing tonight because i want you to work hard in america and i want you to make a contribution to building our economy and there are so many examples of people who have its also important though we give the best possible education to everybody in this country so that you can be competitive i will do what i can working with the teachers of america and dignity injuries of america and secondary education to get more young people the best possible start in life but ill tell you if we dont do something with early childhood education if we dont help and especially can choose first language may not be english if we dont get you a chance to get well prepared for school but youre not going to go as far as you could say thats why i believe those first five years why a really important the family is the first of all the parents in the first teachers and we need to do more to help you prepare your children to be successful in school and so i wanna have universal prekindergarten that will get every opportunity to be prepared and then on the other end i wanted to get in the people in this crowd how many of them had student loans student loans to pay back my husband and me pay them back but it was it like it is today where it costs so much in the interest rates are so high we have forty million americans with student loans to be able to refinance those loans to a lower interest rate and saying i was raising its debt that a young person in america to be able to refinance your dad and then we need to make college affordable i want to offer free community college and get free tuition at any public college or university you can afford to go because heres what happens if youre well even if your grades werent that great you are the resources to go to college and graduate class or youre working poor but youre just an ambitious youre just as willing to do what it takes you may not have the resources to start or you may not have the resources to finish im gonna do everything i can to the any young person in america can get the job training you want an apprenticeship if you wanted fouryear college if you wanted and a price you can pay and that youll be able to pay as a percentage of the income that you like teaching the game get your education republicans it dried times to repeal the affordable care act now they get a republican president lcc i do but i will defend the affordable care act million people are now getting their health care through it some changes that will improve the past and your pocket expenses a prescription drugs that are still sure that people with mental health problems get taken care of just like you are a caregiver for somebody in with any other situation like the professional caregivers think you got some help you know weve got millions of people who are taking care of their loved ones and weve got millions more who are working for the minimum wage to take care of people we cant do that we gotta be smart about how we can for caregiving is we all face the onslaught of alzheimers or what happens when young people with autism get older we got to be prepared for them and theres something else we need to treat right now and thats addiction million people in this country abuse problems alcohol or drugs and they cant get help even if they wanted only one in ten can get help weve got to have more help and more support for families and for those who are dealing with the addicted because right now ended up in jail right and we end up spending more money than i spent a lot of time these days has to be drug courts are about one the other day in western iowa and theyve been doing good work helping folks like me so theyre shutting it down because for somebody to go through drug court be tested to try to get them off drugs get treatment they go to prison for thirty five thousand dollars it makes no sense if we treat people its customers money and save my and help them get better and overcome this problem now theres a lot that we have to fight for against the republicans because they just have a different approach to so many of the issues that i think are important for america today and i will i will fight to defend a womans right to choose and i will efforts to defund planned parenthood and then to make sure that you can bet and you will not be stuck trying to restrict about it and i will do everything i can to overturn a decision called citizens united to make sure to make sure this thing with each other and tired of beginning in the insults in the attacks in the remarks about people because of their heritage of their religion who they are what they do im over it i dont think that i dont think that you realize we get a political differences we do have political differences we should always be treating each other with respect and that cant happen if youre being you or your being and so i feel were missing something right now in our politics were not bringing people together to try to find common ground the way we need to because theres a big group that dont want to try they believe they have all the answers i dont think anybody on this earth has all the answers i think we should be listening and learning from each other you know when i was first lady we were really hard to get health care and i said ok we failed what we gonna do now i got to work to try to figure out how were gonna insured children i work with republicans democrats and we ended up starting the childrens health insurance program which takes care and provides health care to eight million children in america today and when i went to the senate i learned that our national guards men and women were not getting health care except when they were deployed you think that was right teamed up with a republican senator lindsey graham running for president on the other side we work together at some point you know weve been hard work on anything else but that one issue but it made a difference we passed a bill to get health care guardsmen women so they can be helped their families can be home when i was secretary of state i worked with republicans we negotiated a deal to correct the nuclear weapons in the united states in russia and ive worked with republicans to paris votes it was important treaty to each other has tried so hard to find common ground and he has reached out and he has invited people and they just get further and further away in their attitude basically has become they dont even like their own speaker of the house because in their view of six hundred percent with them with anybody in my husband understands that was built and people talking and then finding those areas of agreement thats what weve got to get back to do again anywhere anytime to talk to anybody about finding common ground that i will also be and because i think president will be to raise incomes for the middle class deported opportunity still every child in this country has a chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential and of course im feeling that particularly strongly these days i now have a granddaughter who is white and grandparents dont get a start it we spent a lot of time you know just looking after you just incredibly wonderful and well do everything we can to make sure she has opportunities she can have in her life think every family tries to do that for their children and their grandchildren we have a lot more blessings but you know its not enough we do what we can for charlotte because it matters we couldnt tree tree she becomes an adult is going to be waiting out there for her will it be safe will it be prosperous will it be peace americas still be the land of opportunity where immigrants are welcome and where hard work is rewarding and where people can get ahead and steve is going to be there im betting that it would but its not gonna happen by just venting to me i told you my grandfather was a factory worker my granddaughter is the granddaughter of former president its not enough that the granddaughter of a former president it had to be sure that the granddaughter of factory workers in the grandsons of truck drivers and the grand jury teachers and workers and thats why i need your helpeverybody i just told danielle she really nailed that introduction she said she had been practicing it last night i said theres no substitute for practicing you stand up in front of a crowd of people and i think we should give her another round of applause organized people but not exclusively young who are filled organizing who are volunteering fulltime our fellows who are part of this process and i could not be prouder we have an amazing team across the state who are working every single day they just had a training session with new thirty organizers of the hundred fellows and we welcome each and every one of you to be part of this wedding campaign so that you can see firsthand what its like the tried to work in a campaign on behalf a better future for all of us and i am grateful to any and all the hardworking team here and i will i want to thank president route for inviting me here im always impressed by what i fear is happening at uni was told about a certain football game as well but theres a lot more going on in addition to winning at football i think this university is winning in a lot of ways and for that i congratulate not only the leadership but all of you who are part of making a difference here i just had a chance to visit with a group and faculty d as well as some others from different colleges and universities about the issue of domestic violence and sexual assault on campus i did that in part because i care deeply about the issue and rolling out some policies today that i think would help us move this forward so that we would have more comprehensive services for survivors we would have much more emphasis on a fair process and figure out exactly how you do that and we would increase prevention efforts are part of the reason i wanted to come here and to talk about this is because yesterday we celebrated the st anniversary of the violence against women act and that was a landmark piece of legislation in our country and in fact in the world the person chosen by then president clinton efforts to translate into reality what we meant by trying to prevent violence against women was the former attorney general iowa bonnie campbell who is here with us and where his body i wanted a lot of their shoes back to the office and the department of justice she has made it her lifes work she went with me when i went to beijing in on behalf of the united states to state what should have been obvious but needed to be said that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights once and for all with me because it wasnt just enough to go and make a speech that was important i didnt realize fully the importance until i was very nervous i did it a lot of people didnt want me to go i thought i should but still wasnt clear exactly what the outcome would be so it was important to have with me people like bonnie who were doing the work that the united states had to leave to actually translate into positive programs policies changes what we meant we talked about womens rights and human rights and particularly the scourge of violence against women so this is a special high in a special place to be talking specifically about an issue that affects one in five women on campus and it is something deeply important to me to try to work together with everybody to bring about the changes that are necessary and behavior and attitude tried to confront the continuing challenge of violence against women and in particular here on campuses now i want to be sure that we have a chance to talk further about that but i also want to lay out some of the other elements of my my agenda because i happen to think that we have to get the basic bargain in america working again for everybody what do i mean by that well its pretty simple actually you work hard and you do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead thats how its supposed to work in america that is how it has worked for generations my dad father was a factory worker he went to work every single day of his life in the hills worked there for many years he did it because he had to support his family but he also did it because he believed as an immigrant to this country that it would be better for his children that they would have a better life that is the essence of the dream of the bargain right and it worked three sides they all got to go to college and my dad got out of college in the middle of the depression he couldnt find a job jumped out of freight train dont do this took a train to chicago began looking for a job i got a job as a salesman worked for a number of years went into the navy during world war two and when it came out he started a small business and he worked really hard so there was a very small business but it provided a good solid middleclass life for my family so here i am running for president three generations and i am deeply grateful to the hard work and sacrifice of my family parents and grandparents but to country because this country held out promise it made a bargain with them that was capped and i want to be the president who make sure i can look in the eyes of every single person particularly young people in this country and tell you honestly and truly were keeping that bargain for you to look at anybody everybody uses climate change syrian refugees and i am prepared and ready to do that you know im gonna go she hated a ceasefire between israel and hamas in gaza i put together the coalition that came up with the sanctions that brought iran to the negotiating table i know what we have to do to protect our country to protect our security and to meet the big challenges but i also know that a lot of what is affecting people today is whats going on in their lives how do they afford college how do they pay off the debt once they get out of college how do they afford child care if they get that job that they how do they get equal pay for equal work if they are us from the headlines that must be addressed by american leadership also ready to take on those issues that keep you up at night you talked about around the kitchen table a source of worry and concern i hear about them some amazing experiences in the last months coming back into politics traveling around elsewhere people tell me the most personal concerns tell me about their friends child but they just buried from a drug overdose they tell me about their mother their fifty eightyearold mother who got addicted to opioids and just died tell me about the untreated mental health and the absolute inexplicable decision by your governor to shut down to appear for help really really grabbed me they touched my heart because i know what its like to worry i know what its like to have to be concerned about whats happening to somebody you care about somebody you love you and your family a friend yes i wanna be the president also trying to figure out how to how are you with more opportunities and more tools and more support the deal with all of those problems as well and when it comes to how were going to keep that basic bargain and fulfil that dream again first and foremost we gotta get the economy working for everybody theres no two ways about it if it doesnt work for everybody not just those at the top so much of what we want to do in our country cannot be realized i will tell you without trying to be either partisan her personal our country does better we have a democrat in the white house and i watch my husbands presidency how hard it was trying to undo the effects of trickledown economics but by the end of those eight years peacetime expansion million new jobs and incomes rose not just lonely at the top but in the middle and at the bottom everybody was starting to do better and we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus which would have given us real opportunities in dealing with our longterm challenges so i was elected in in the senate from new york fiftyfive percent of all over million votes so i went to the senate really energized about what we could do to chart a sensible course that would continue our economic upward movement very different the new republican administration they want to undo everything that had been done the last eight years they want to go back to trickledown economics cut taxes on the wealthy get out of the way of corporations and everything will just be by you know how that turned out shortly after the november election got a call from then presidentelect obama he said he wanted to come see him in chicago i really had no idea why he wanted me to be secretary of state but in large measure he wanted to talk about why he needed me to go out and deal with the incredible problems we were inherited around the world while he tried to deal with the extraordinary problems we had inherited right here at home with an economy in recession elected president and you get handed the worst financial crisis since the great depression the republicans want us to have amnesia about why that happened dont they want to just forget that it happened on their watch their policies thanks to the hard work of the american people and the leadership of president obama who does not get the credit he deserves for digging us out were standing my goodness we became president jobs covered more than million but we have a ways to go yet even though we are recovering jobs we havent recovered paychecks and income people are not back to where they were before this big crash wiped out jobs wiped out well and decrease to do so we have to have an economic policy that will reverse this thats what i have laid out i have laid out a specific set of policies that are aimed at raising incomes again because i think that is the central defining issue in this campaign how we gonna raise americans incomes and how are we going to make sure that the hard work americans do the productivity that we have is going to be rewarded by a share of the profits they help to make for the corporations and businesses they work for i am going to do everything i can to incentivize profitsharing it doesnt matter to me if your are in the headquarters or youre on the factory floor if that company youre working for is turning a profit you should be rewarded and that is exciting but i think its important because you know we need an agenda about what were fighting for this campaign personalities are important i believe that ive been around politics but you know what i have found is that what people tell you theyre going to do because chances are they will try to do it and thats especially important when it comes to women and womens issues because what you will if you listen to republicans is they have a very different idea about what to do with the economy now clearly they want to go back to trickledown economics you gotta admire their persistence in believing a failed policy i suppose there is something that you got to give them credit for their we cant afford to go through that again thats what they are they would do as president cut taxes on the wealthy one more time get out of the way of corporations but that polo let them let them take advantage of workers ok now we know better than that but its also important to listen to them when they talk about women because to me that a lot of what i believe is important for women for families and for our economy is just not on their radar screen at all so when i talk about strong grow hair growth and longterm bro i have a central plain about how we have to make it more available to women to be in the work force and to afford to be there in order to stay engaged to contribute to their own wellbeing and that of their family and the economy because in the work force you just look at the numbers again family leave a womans issue but its also an economic issue you shouldnt have to lose your paycheck or your job when you have a new baby or a family member gets sick we make it just about as hard as we can imagine more women to be able to balance family and work now i know there are men who do it as well but predominantly it is still women carry for newborns and babies caring for relatives spouses and parents and others and equal pay that shouldnt even be debated debating it you know i dont understand and womens futures and the future of families and our economy is an issue i take serious and its one that im campaigning off and im going to continue to speak out about raising the minimum wage is a womens issue right of the people they paid minimum wage in america are women and heres one of the worst things a lot of americans dont know about this and i am trying to talk about it so i can get a real groundswell of support as we raise the minimum wage in the congress which we will get to it will be a hard job but if we can elect a more democrats for the next election will raise the minimum and when we raise wages in states and localities which i also support do not forget there are people in many places in america today predominantly women who get what is called that tipped minimum wage know what that is they could be paid as little as our waitress bartender because they will get up to the minimum wage with tips the reality is that often not the case that in fact they may not get those tips or they have to be harassed if their employer pockets those tips so when we raise the minimum wage were going to do away with this credible injustice of the tip minimum wage people are going to all eligible opportunity to increase support women doing work at home and work in the job that leads me to something else we have to do and that is confronting the epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses across our country i saw a head nod when i said one in five women report they were sexually assaulted during college around you if we were to have one out of every five women stand up that was a pretty big crowd here the impact on their lives theyre trying to manage the emotional or physical sometimes educational financial follow miss classes some dropout never finish their education thankfully this is an issue that is finally gaining the attention it deserves but it is not enough to condemn campus sexual assault we need to end and waking up to this challenge and i campuses across the country including very impressively this campus people are coming together and coming up with solutions i was really impressed by what i herd has been happening here at uni since you got the first grant from that office campbell first led all those years ago began having what certainly continues to be a somewhat challenging conversation everybody at the table listening to people coming up with a way to approach this problem and try to ended president obamas administration has worked hard to shine a bright light on campus sexual assault and i intend to keep talking about it and building on that heres why right now in too many places survivors dont know where to go to go to try to get help some campuses dont even offer support and services including counseling and health care so a lot of young women are truly lost and left at others presented maze of bureaucracy that forces survivors to navigate that without any real help one of the most he times of their lives as president all fight to make sure every campus offers every survivor support she needs and well make sure that those services are comprehensive confidential and coordinated i want to add to that although survivors of sexual assault are predominantly women is also happy two men it happens to transgender community it happens to others as well so it mattered gender sexual orientation ethnicity race services have to be there for everyone the process campus is confusing and many who do choose which is a hard choice i recognize to report in the criminal justice system fear that their voices will be dismissed instead heard so we need to ensure a fair process for all involved whether its in campus disciplinary proceedings or the criminal justice system rate is it wherever it happens and school i think its both a legal obligation and they moral obligation to protect every students right to get an education free from discrimination free from fear particularly as to ones safety reports of sexual assault need to be treated with the seriousness professionalism and fairness they deserve now we have a great resource in our nations law students who on many campuses can help them navigate this process there are some successful law clinic models across the country where students are already working alongside experienced attorneys to provide valuable assistance back when i was in law school i volunteered for the new haven legal services program the best things i did in law school thats part of what inspired me to go to work for the childrens defense fund after i graduated and so im looking for good ideas that come from any where i heard some great ones upstairs and i want to come in young man from one of the fraternities here on campus who has taken on the issue the fraternity has taken on the issue of working to try to change attitudes to educate not only their fraternity members but the broader campus and even beginning to reach out into the community and i want to also amanda mentoring program for violence prevention that was originated here on campus there are good smart solutions we just need more awful and we need to read them so that more people have access to them there are the issues of responsibility and respect that started long before students arrived on campus i dont think its enough to try to get a better response once an assault we need a stop sexual assault from happening in the first place and we need strong prevention efforts to change attitudes associated with violence we need to be spreading the ideas and talking to young people literally started in high school about issues like consent and bystander prevention is the lot bigger than a single conversation freshman orientation or as i heard earlier an online program everybody has to take but its kind of in isolation you have to talk about this i have to listen to each other to try to understand that this is a serious problem that can be solved something that everybody can play a part in addressing today i want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault dont let anyone silence your voice you have the right to be heard you have the right to be believed and were with you as you on our campuses happens in the workplace happens in the military for too many it happens in homes and in their communities that we need to take this on as a broader campaign against violence stops in afflicts women and girls here at home and across the world now im well aware when i talk about these issues like paid leave people pay for equal work reproductive rights sexual assault against people on campus republicans often say im playing the gender card well if supporting womens health and womens rights is playing the gender card deal me in because that and we can expect to hear more of the same the top down out of touch policies that theyve been talking for years they actually seem oblivious or indifferent how their ideas would hurt people last time not one of them had a single word to say about how to make college more affordable not a word equal pay for women or pay a family leave or quality affordable preschool so our kids who get the best start in life no real ideas about promoting clean energy of combating climate change to keep growing the economy or trying to bring down skyrocketing prescription drug costs us ending the gun violence that plagues our communities clearly lives matter and no one defending marriage equality somewhat entertaining frontrunner has grabbed a lot of attention lately but if you look at the policies of all of them running theyre pretty much the same their truck just without the pizzazz in the hair and demean women havent you my way recently said i dont have a clue about womens health issues he do a much better job for women that i would and i set that is a general election to be really about denying victims of rape and incest access to abortion governor bush says five hundred million dollars is too much to spend on womens health bad cars in a medical doctor when asked if he supports life of the mother exceptions to abortion bans said im not sure that the legitimate argument and every single one of them wants to defund planned parenthood meet the mom her breast cancer early because she got screen or the teenager who avoided an unintended pregnancy because she had access to birth control or the survivor of sexual assault turned to planned parenthood for emergency contraception and testing and support now these views might be acceptable in a republican primary but they are dead wrong for st century america and we climate changes are going back to trickledown economics do matter what they call at this time ive been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life now if you want a president who will tell you everything thats wrong about america and who is to blame for it youve got plenty of other choices but if you want a president who will work her heart out to forge a better stronger and fairer country and america that works for people again youre looking at ur wherever you have them in the real world and the virtual next time someone sends you a text or an invite to play candy crush ask them if theyre caught the sea and right now you can text shan gao i and and go to hillary clinton dot com i think this campaign is one of the most important weve had in a really long time im not running for my husbands thirdterm and im not running for president obamas third term im running for my first term but i can tell you id watch what i know how hard it is our fingers and make the changes we think are best for america weepy snap this is hard this state intense effort to find common ground to build those relationships i did it and i was in the white house when i was in the senate and a secretary of state you know after i worked really hard to try to get health care and we got to rail i could have given up but i did i said ok lets at least get health care for our children and i work with congress members and others to get the childrens health insurance program that insures more than eight million kids to this day and when i would i worked with anybody who i thought had a good idea no pride of authorship i work actually with one of the fellows running for president on the other side because we both saw the same problem in our respective states lindsey graham rsouth carolina me from new york national guard and reserve members who werent getting health care we did bipartisan legislation to make sure those who served our country got the care they deserve reaching out constantly looking for ways to find common ground with republicans i will go anywhere anytime to speak to anybody about trying to find a common ground i think thats what youre supposed to do in a democracy for different country theres a couple then we could names pretty big ones and contentious ones out there are you just do what youre told democracy theres no consensus theres no compromise their way or no way something we work in america its frustrating but over time we keep making progress together and we produced results if we stick with it i will stand my ground against those who want to rip out the progress that we have made together over the last years cant do it without your health i think we are on the way to a campaign of great significance in laying out an agenda that people can actually believe is possible and then having election on that agenda and then getting to work every single day to achieve it so please join me in helping to build an america where everyone has a child has a shot at achieving your dreams and living up to their potential and yes were a father and say to his daughter you can be anything you want even president of the united stateschristie vilsack leonard and dodi boswell and your congressman for iowa dave loebsack and i have to give i have to give a special shout out to somebody really special somebody whose birthday is tomorrow someone who reminds us that sometimes you just have to let him hear you roar katy perry thank you las vegas you know when republicans debate they compete to insult each other demean women and they doubledown on trickledown actually it is reality tv with a cast of characters who dont care much about actual reality but theres a big difference when we democrats debate you see something you see us tackling the hard issues looking for solutions to our biggest challenges facing our families and our countrys how we gonna raise wages and create more good jobs how will we respond to climate change and lift up our economy by investing in clean energy how will we make college affordable and get parents the paid leave they need how will we working with our teachers and our families help our kids get ready to succeed in school and how how are we going to rein in wall street and lift up main street and how much longer can we wait to stand up to that gun lobby and keep our kids and our communities safe in america democrats are offering real solutions like president obama has done for the past six and a half years and by his side every step of the way has been vice president joe biden has passionately for middleclass families and middleclass values lets show him how much we appreciate vice president joe biden all hes done for our country lets give it up for the vice president no i think its really important in this election to remember what president obama inherited the republicans would like us all to forget but he inherited the worst financial crisis since the great depression we were losing jobs a month in right after that election he called me asked me to come see him in chicago i didnt know why it turned out he wanted to be to be secretary of state but when we got there it was just the two of us and we were just talking and he was talking about what he was facing he said you know its so much worse they told us we were losing jobs a month million americans ended up losing their jobs and five million lost their homes and listen to this thirteen trillion dollars of family wealth was wiped away i dont think president obama gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from falling enjoy great depression hes saved the auto industry he impose tough new rules on wall street and the extended health care million americans what you can expect when you vote for democrats when theres a democrat in the white house america creates more jobs the economy grows faster and deficits are smaller and even though they hate it when i say this recessions happened four times more frequently under republican presidents so we cannot afford to go back to the republicans failed policies now im not running for my husbands thirdterm and im not running for barack obamas third term im running for my first and im running as a proud democrat we need to defend the progress weve made under president obama and build on it until the recovery is secure and all americans have a chance to raise their incomes and to believe once again in the basic part of america you know what it is if you work hard and you do your part should be able to get ahead and stay ahead but republicans and their allies have stacked the deck for those at the top there is something wrong when the top hedge fund managers on more in a year than all that kindergarten teachers in america come by or top ceos makes three hundred times what a typical worker does add or when corporate profits soar but employees dont share in those profits when its easy for a big corporation to get a tax break but its still too hard for a small business to get a loan when the ceo of a drug company jacks up the price of lifesaving medicine thousand percent overnight and when the governor of this state he chose a bipartisan compromise to fund schools and keep mental health facility is open and now now your governor is threatening to privatize medicaid and the hawkeye childrens health insurance program something i helped to start in the nineteen nineties and thousands of iowans are standing up and saying enough and im standing with you i gotta tell you that the republican candidates can help themselves theyre pushing the same failed policies that crashed our economy before you know what they are cutting taxes on the super wealthy letting big corporations write their own rules busting unions ignoring the middle class weve heard all this before and we know what it does and of course none of them is serious about climate change i love it when theyre asked about it you know what their answer is im not a scientist well why dont they start listening to those who are scientists and understanding what were up against around the world republicans in congress have now voted more than times to repeal or weaken the affordable care act they want to force americans that is worthy of a big bunch of booze because force americans to start a contentious health care debate all over again now i believe we can improve the affordable care act but were not going to let them take us back to insurance companies were riding their own rules again you know what that was like they even charge women more for our coverage than men and we sure cant let them take us back to the wild west on wall street rep shield doddfrank destroy the consumer financial protection board we are going to stand firm thats why i proposed tough actions to end the abuses by the big banks and the excessive risk in the socalled shadow banking system we are going just stop wall street hurting mainstream and here we are everyone here is here because you know whats at stake in this election no matter who youre for thats pretty clear standing up here see whos sitting where but we all agree on this we cant let republicans keep rigging our elections with secret unaccountable of dark money we need a supreme court that protects the right of every citizen to vote not the right of every corporation to buy elections and i said from the very beginning of my campaign even if it takes a constitutional amendment we will overturn citizens united once and for all and you know i sometimes i sometimes wonder whether you sign up to be a republican candidate for president they put you into some kind of time machine and they take you back fifty years because they keep saying the same out of date out of touch things we will never let the republicans or privatize social security or end medicare as some promising i am going to and support what president obama has done to protect dreamers and their families to use executive action to prevent deportation if we cannot get comprehensive immigration reform as we need and as we should with a real path to citizenship that will actually grow our economy then i will go as far as i can even beyond president obama to make sure law abiding decent hardworking people in this country are not ripped away from their families people claim big government republicans sure love using government to step in and make decisions for women about our bodies and our right i will do everything to protect a womans right to choose and a defend planned parenthood card talk about equal pay paid family leave affordable child care and womens health is playing the gender card deal just to rail against the republic billionaires we actually have to win this election in order to rebuild the middle class and make a positive difference in peoples lives we have to build an america again measured by how many people work their way into the middle class not how many ceos get bonuses by how many children climb out of poverty how many families can afford health care how many young people can go to college without taking on gears we should measures success in this country as i said at the debate in las vegas im a progressive who likes to get things done as a smart man once said theres nothing wrong with america that cant be fixed by what is right with america i donald trump when he says we have to make america great again heres what i say america is great we just have to make it fair and just we have to make america work for everyone not just those at the top that when americans come together come up with smart solutions and fight to get results theres no challenge we cant meet in at the top of my list of fights we have to wage and when its this americans need a raise thats why we must raise the minimum wage no one who works full time should live in poverty and i want companies to have incentives to share more of their profits with their employees who helped make those profits in the first place and companies that ship jobs and profits overseas shouldnt get tax breaks you should get tax breaks again i said i want to be the small business president and i mean it because small businesses will create most of the good new jobs of the future and they should have less red tape easier access to credit and tax relief and to create those new goodpaying jobs we have to get back to investing in science and medical research we should establish an infrastructure bank to put americans to work building our roads our bridges are airports are rails are broadband networks and i believe i believe we can make america the worlds clean energy superpower by setting and reaching big goals again half a billion solar panels installed in four years and enough renewable energy produced up power every home in america and ten years can be done because i was already leading the way youre producing roughly a third of your total electricity from wind and other renewables i want the rest of the country to follow your lead our economy to grow like it should then we have to make sure women who still earn less than men on the job and women of color who earned least of all finally get a quote pay for equal work shortchanged you shortchange families and you shortchange america and my college compact will help students and graduates refinance their debt just like you can with a mortgage or car loan and no one will have to borrow a cent to attend community college or pay tuition at a public college or university but let me say this for a growth and fairness economy that works for everyone we cant forget acquired or problems that often dont make the headlines im also writing for the grandmother who told me shes raising her grandchild because of her daughters struggle with drug addiction but the mom who asked me what shes going to do when her child with autism gets older for every family trying to cope with untreated mental illness im fighting for the man i met whose mother has alzheimers he cant afford a fulltime caretaker so you know what he does hes a teacher he takes his mother to work with him for lgbt americans who despite all our progress and get married on saturday and fired on monday in a lot of states just because of who they are and who they love for our veterans of all ages who served our country with honor and courage and deserve the benefits theyve earned without delays or abuses fighting to reform criminal justice for every mother and father who worry every day that their child will be stopped by the police just for being africanamerican because she has black wives matter fighting to protect our kids in communities from the plague of gun violence you should be safe when you go to school when you go to the movies when you go to church thats why im proposing commonsense gun safety measures like universal background checks closing the loopholes that let guns fall into the hands of those who shouldnt have them and repealing the law that shields gun makers and sellers from accountability been told to stop shouting about ending gun violence well i havent been shouting but sometimes when a woman speaks out some people think its shouting i wont be silenced and i hope you wont be either how many more people have to die before we take action now folks ive been at this effort to change and reform our country for a long time and i havent won every battle but ive learned from each one i know how to stand my ground and how to find common brown thats how i worked with a republican congress to help create the childrens health insurance program which covers eight million kids thats why as a senator i work with republicans to expand health benefits for our national guard and reserves and for the firefighters and police officers who rushed or danger on and later groups sick from their time at ground zero and secretary of state i bought for human rights womens rights lgbt rights internet freedom american jobs and security around persuading russia and china to join in imposing the toughest sanctions in history on iran and working with republicans and democrats to get the votes we needed to ratify a landmark nuclear arms control treaty id spent my life working for children women families in our country from the kitchen table to the peace table trying to even the odds for people who have the odds stacked against them and im just getting warmed job with your support im going to deliver and i didnt learn about fairness justice opportunity and the american dream from politics i learned about it from my own family my dad around a small business in chicago printing drapery fabric taught me that anything good in life is worth working for and my mom had a hard life abandoned mistreated and working as a maid at the age of fourteen told me that it crucial moments people showed her kindness like that first grade teacher who made sure she had enough to eat when her parents didnt even care enough to make sure that thats what about many reasons im grateful to our educators instead of becoming bitter or broken she became resilient she taught me that everybody gets knocked down in life but that doesnt mean you stay down get back up face your challenge just solve your problems dont just complain about them the granddaughter of a factory worker in the grandmother of the most wonderful little girl in the world i will do everything we can to ensure she has every opportunity to succeed in life but i dont think you should have to be the grand daughter of a former president bashar in the promise of america granddaughters and grandsons of factory workers and truck drivers and nurses and farmers should have that same chance to every one of americas children and grandchildren should have the opportunity to live up to their godgiven potential thats what im fighting for those struggling striving and the successful im fighting for everyone whos ever been knocked down but refused to be knocked out and together were going to build an america where there are no feelings for anyone where no one gets left behind or left out and yes were a father can tell his daughter you can be anything you want a big and bloated presidentyou know over the past several months i have listened to the problems that keep american families up at night now most people dont expect life to be easy but they want more security a good paying job that lets you afford a middleclass lifestyle health care you can count on a little bit put away for your retirement being secure also means being safe safe at home at school at work today i want to talk about how we keep our country safe from the threat thats on everyones minds the threat of terrorism but i want to begin by saying we cannot give in to fear we cant let it stop us from doing what is right and necessary to make us safe and doing it in a way that is consistent with our values we cannot let fear push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe americans are going to have to act with both courage and clarity now as we all know on december nd to shoulders killed people at a holiday party in san bernardino california sadly in america and turning on the news and hearing about a mass shooting is not unusual but this one turned out to be different because these killers were a husband and wife inspired by isis americans have experienced terrorism before a we learned that terrorists in afghanistan could strike our homeland from fort hood to chattanooga to the boston marathon we saw people radicalized here carrying out deadly attacks but san bernardino felt different maybe it was the timing coming so soon after the paris attacks maybe it was how random it seemed a terrorist attack in a suburban office not a highprofile target or symbol of american power it made us all feel that could have been anywhere at any time the phrase active shooter should not be one we have to teach our children but it is we are all grappling with what this means for future for our safety our sense of wellbeing and our trust and connections with our neighbors we want to be open hearted and we want to celebrate americas diversity not hear it and while we know the overwhelming majority of people here and around the world hate isis and love peace we do have to be prepared for more terrorists plotting attacks just yesterday a man in maryland was charged with receiving thousands of dollars from isis for use in planning an attack and here in minnesota authorities have charged men with conspiring to provide material support to isis but in the twin cities you have also seen firsthand how communities come together to resist radicalization logo imams condemning terrorist violence local artists and activists pushing back against terrorist propaganda i just met with a group of community leaders told me about some of the work and the challenges that they are dealing with as the first somaliamerican police sergeant in minnesota and probably in the country said recently safety is a shared responsibility so we have to work together the threat the threat we face is daunting but america has overcome big challenges many times before throughout our history we have stared into the face of evil and refused to blank wed be fascism won the cold war brought osama bin laden to justice so no one should ever underestimate the determination of the american people and im confident we will once again shoes resolve over fear and we will defeat these new enemies just as we have defeated those who threatened us in the past because it is not enough to contain isis we must defeat isis break its momentum and then its back and not just isis but the broader radical jihadist movement that also includes alqaida and offshoots like alshabab in somalia now waging and winning this fight will require serious leadership but unfortunately our political debate has been anything but serious we cant afford another major ground war in the middle east thats exactly what isis wants from us shallow slogans dont add up to a strategy promising to carpet bomb until the desert blows doesnt make you sound strong it makes you sound like youre in over your head and bigotry are not credentials for becoming commander in chief and it is hard to take seriously senators who talked tough but then holed up key national security nominations including the top official at the treasury department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing every day thats wasted on partisan gridlock could put americans in danger so yes we need a serious discussion and thats why in a speech last month before the council on foreign relations i laid out a threepart plan to defeat isis and the broader extremist movement one defeat isis in the middle east by smashing its stronghold hitting its fighters leaders and infrastructure from the air and intensifying support for local forces who can pursue them on the ground second defeat them around the world by dismantling the global network of terror that supplies radical jihadists with money arms propaganda and fighters and third defeat them fear at home by foiling plots disrupting radicalization and hard during our defenses now these three lines of effort reinforce one another so we need to pursue them all at once using every pillar of american power it will require skillful diplomacy to continue secretary careys efforts to encourage political reconciliation in iraq and political transition in syria enabling more sunni arabs and kurdish fighters to take on isis on both sides of the border and to get our arab and turkish partners to actually step up and do their part it will require more usa and allied air power and a broader targets set for strikes by planes and drones with proper safeguards it will require special operations units to advise and train local forces and conduct key counterterrorism mission what it will not require is of thousands of american combat troops that is not the right action for us to take in this situation so there is a lot to do today i want to focus on the third part of my plan how we defend our country and prevent radicalization here at home we need a comprehensive strategy to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack like the one in san bernardino first we have to shut down isis recruitment in the united states especially online second stop wouldbe jihadists from getting training overseas and stop foreign terrorists from coming here third discover and disrupt plots before they can be carried out fourth support law enforcement officers who risked their lives to prevent and respond to attacks and fifth in power are muslim american communities who are on the front lines this is a degree strategy to keep america safe and i wanna walk through each of the elements from recruitment to training to planning execution thurs shutting down recruitment we have to stop jihadists from radicalizing new recruits in person and through social media chat rooms and whats called the dark web to do that we need stronger relationships between washington silicon valley and all of our great tech companies and entrepreneurs american innovation is a powerful force and we have to put it to work defeating isis that starts with understanding where and how recruitment happens our security professionals need to more effectively tracked and analyzed isis is social media posts and map jihadist networks and they need help from the tech community companies should redouble their efforts to maintain and enforce their own service agreement and other necessary policies to police their networks identifying extremist content and removing it now many are already doing this and sharing those best practices more widely is important at the state department i started an inter agency centre to combat violent jihadist messages to have a better way to communicate on behalf of our values and to give young people drawn to those messages an alternative narrative we recruited specialist low and in arabic urdu and somali to wage on line battles with extremist to counter their propaganda now these efforts have not kept pace with the threat so we need to step up our game in partnership with the private sector and credible moderate voices outside government but thats just some of what we have to do experts from the fbi the intelligence community homeland security dod state department and the technology industry should work together to develop a unified national strategy to defeat isis in cyberspace using all of our capabilities to deny jihadist virtual territory just as we work to deny them actual territory and at the same time we have to do more to address the challenge of radicalization whatever form it takes its imperative that the saudis that galleries the pilates and others stop their citizens from supporting radical schools madrasas and mosques around the world once and for all and that should be the top priority in all of our discussions with these countries now second we have to prevent isis recruits from training abroad and prevent foreign jihadists from coming here most urgent is stemming the flow of fighters from europe and america to iraq and syria and then back home again the united states and our allies needs to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip and then share information with each other in real time right now european nations dont always alert each other when they turn away a suspected extremist at the border or when a passport is stolen they have to dramatically improve intelligencesharing and counterterrorism cooperation and were ready to help them do that we also need to take down the network of enablers who helped jihadis finance and facilitate their travel forged documents and evade detection and the united states and our allies should commit to revoke the passports and visas of jihadists who have gone to join isis or other groups and bring the full force of the law against them as ive said before united states has to take a close look at our visa programs and i am glad the administration and congress are stepping up scrutiny in the wake of san bernardino and that should include scrutinizing applicants social media postings we also should just dispatched more homeland security agents to high risk countries to better investigate these applicants for many years america has waived visa requirements for travelers from countries with reliable security procedures including key allies in europe and asia that makes sense but we also have to be smart except for limited exceptions like diplomats and aid workers and they want to as traveled in the past five years to a country facing serious problems with terrorism and foreign fighters should have to go through a full these investigation no matter where theyre from we also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from syria guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals rigorous vetting already takes place while refugees are still overseas and its a process that historically takes to months but congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough passable process and just as importantly we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations applying a religious test that discriminates against muslims slamming the door on every single syrian refugee that is not who we are as americans we are better than that it would be a cruel irony indeed if isis can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones so after rigorous screening we should welcome families fleeing syria just as the twin cities and this state have welcomed previous generations of refugees exiles and immigrants the key used to prevent terrorists also from exploiting our compassion and endangering our security we can do this and i think we must third we have to discover and disrupt jihadist plots before they can be carried out this is going to take better intelligence collection analysis and sharing i proposed an intelligence surged against isis that includes more operations officers and linguists enhancing our technical surveillance of overseas targets intercepting terrorists communications flying more reconnaissance missions to track terrorist movements and developing even closer partnerships with other intelligence services president obama recently signed the usa freedom act which was passed by a bipartisan majority in congress it protects civil liberties while maintaining capabilities that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep us safe however the new law is now under attack from presidential candidates on the left and right somewhat strip away crucial counterterrorism tools even with appropriate judicial and congressional oversight and others seem eager to go back to discredited practices of the past i dont think we can afford to let either of you prevail now encryption of mobile devices and communications does present a particularly tough problem with important implications for security and civil liberties law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals warn that impenetrable encryption may make it harder for them to investigate plots and prevent future attacks on the other hand there are very legitimate worries about privacy network security and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit i know theres no magic fix to this dilemma that will satisfy all these concerns but we cant just throw up our hands but tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to keep us safe from terrorists and even as we make sure law enforcement officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks its essential that we also make sure jihadis dont get the tools they need to carry out attacks it defies common sense that republicans in congress refuse to make it harder for potential terrorists to buy guns you are too dangerous to buy a gun and we should and comprehensive background checks and close loopholes that allow potential terrorists to buy weapons online or at gun shows and i think its time to restore the ban on assault weapons and high capacity nothing to do with terrorism for them terrorists use guns to kill americans and i think we should make it a lot harder for them to do that every day and theres a question a question they should be asked why dont the republican candidates want to do that uci of this old fashioned idea that we elect a president in part in large part to keep us safe from terrorists from gun violence from whatever threatens our families and communities and im not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me thats not the right path now the fourth in my strategy is supporting law enforcement officers who risked their lives to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks in san bernardino city county state and federal authorities acted with speed and courage to prevent even more loss of life detective was honor a fifteenyear police veteran assured terrified civilians ill take a bullet before you do there is no limit to the gratitude we all to law enforcement professionals like that detective who run toward danger to try to save lives and not just in the immediate wake of an attack our police firefighters and emergency responders will keep putting their lives on the line long after the cameras move on its really disgraceful that congress has thus far failed to keep faith with first responders suffering from a lasting health effects of women i was so proud to represent as a senator from new york theres a drug health act never should have been allowed to lapse it looks like majority leader mcconnell may have finally dropped his opposition and i hope the american people will hold him to that and we will continue to honor the service and sacrifice of those who responded to the worst terrorist attack in our history we have to make sure that local law enforcement has the resources and training they need to keep us safe and they should be more closely synched up with national counter terrorism experts including with better use of fusion centers that serve as clearing houses for intelligence and coordination and we need to strengthen our defenses and are resilient wherever were vulnerable whether its soft targets like shopping malls or higher profile targets like airports railways or power plants we have to build on the progress of the obama administration and locking down loose nuclear materials and other wmd so they never fall into the hands of terrorists who seek them actively around the world so we should be providing the department of homeland security with the resources it needs to stay one step ahead not trying to privatize he functions like tsa as some republicans have proposed and its important for us to recognize that when we talk about law enforcement we have made progress in being sure that our federal authorities share information with our state and local authorities but that was an issue i tackled after and we have to stay really vigilant so that information is in the hands where it needs to be now finally the fifth element in the strategy is empowering muslim american communities who are on the front lines in the fight against radicalization there are millions of peaceloving american muslims living working raising families paying taxes in our country these american americans may be our first last and best defense against homegrown radicalization and terrorism they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before its too late intervene to help a young person straight they are the best position to block anything going forward thats why law enforcement has worked so hard since to build up trust and strong relationships within muslim american communities here in the twin cities you have an innovative partnership that brings together parents teachers imams and others in the somaliamerican community with law enforcement nonprofits local businesses mental health professionals and others to intervene with young people who are at risk its called the building community resilience pilot program and it deserves increased support it has not gotten the financial resources that it needs to do everything the people involved in it know they can do and weve got to do a better job of support now i know like many places across the country theres more work to do to increase trust between communities in law enforcement just last month i no hear a young africanamerican man was fatally shot by a police officer and i understand an investigation is underway whatever the outcome tragedies like this raised had questions about racial justice in america and put at risk efforts to build the community relationships that help keep us safe from crime and from terrorism when people see that respect and trust are two way streets they are more likely to work handinhand with law enforcement one of the mothers of men recently charged with conspiring with terrorists said we have to stop the denial he told other parents we have to talk to our kids and work with the fbi thats a message we need to hear from leaders within muslim american communities across our country but we also want to highlight the successes and muslim american communities and there are so many of them i just met with the first somaliamerican council member of the city council here proudly telling me how much change somali immigrants now muslim americans have made in parts of the city in neighborhoods that had been pretty much hollowedout lets look at the successes if were going to fully integrate everyone into america then we need to be seeing all their contributions to and that is one of the many reasons why we must all stand up against offensive inflammatory hate and child mostly rhetoric do these comments cut against everything we stand for as americans they are also dangerous as the director of the fbi told congress recently anything that erodes trust with muslimamericans makes the job of law enforcement more difficult we need every community invested in this fight not alienated and sitting on the sidelines one of the community leaders i met with told me that a lot of the children in the community are now afraid to go to school there not only afraid of being perceived as a threat they are afraid of being threatened because of who they are this is such a open hearted and generous community i hope there will be even more efforts perhaps under the aegis of the university and certainly governor dayton and others to bring people together to reassure members of the community particularly children and teenagers that they are welcome invited and valued here in this city and state a ban on all muslims entering the united states has rightly sparked outrage across our country and around the world even some of the other republican candidates are saying hes gone too far but the truth is many of those same candidates have also said disgraceful things about muslims and this kind of divisive rhetoric actually plays into the hands of terrorists it alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in this fight against isis you know you hear a lot of talk from some of the other candidates about coalitions everyone seems to want one but theres not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to build a coalition and make it work i know how hard this is because ive done it and i can tell you insulting potential allies doesnt make it any easier dehumanizing muslims also feeds a narrative that jihadists you to recruit new followers around the world that the united states is at war with islam as both the pentagon and the fbi have said in the past week we cannot in any way lend credence to that twisted idea this is not a clash of civilization this is a clash between civilization and barbarism and bad how it must be seen and paul open society is a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism i disagree i believe our tolerance and diversity are at the poor of our strength at a naturalization ceremony for new citizens today in washington president obama noted the tension throughout our history between welcoming or rejecting the stranger it is he said about the meaning of america what kind of country do we want to be and its about the capacity of each generation to honor the creed as old as our founding e pluribus unum out of many we are one president obamas right and it matters its no coincidence that american muslims have long been better integrated and less susceptible to radicalization of muslims in less welcoming nations and we cannot give into demagogues who play on our basest instincts we must instead rely on the principles written in to our american dna freedom equality of opportunity america is strongest when all our people believe they have a stake in our country and our future no matter where theyre from what they look like how they worship or who they love our country was founded by people fleeing religious persecution as george washington put it the united states gives to bigotry no sanction to persecution no assistance so to all our muslim american brothers and sisters this is your country true and i am proud to be your fellow america particularly our republican friends at george w bush was right six days after he went muslim community center and heres what he said those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger dont represent the best of america they represent the worst of humankind and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior so america you need look no further than army captain he was born in the united arab emirates moved to maryland as a small child he later graduated from the university of virginia before enlisting in the united states army in june he was serving in iraq one day while his infantry unit was guarding the gates of their base a suspicious vehicle appeared captain khan told his troops to get back but he went forward he took ten steps toward the car before it exploded captain card was killed but his unit was saved by his courageous act captain colin was posthumously awarded the bronze star and purple heart he was just years old we still wonder what made him take those ten steps as father said in a recent interview maybe thats the point he went on where all the values all the service to country all the things he learned in this country kicked in it was those values that made him take those ten steps those ten steps told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country his father as hard as this is it is time to move from fear to resolve to stand up and say we are americans we are the greatest nation on earth not in spite of the challenges we faced but because of them americans will not buckle or break we will not turn on each other or turn on our principles ads we will pursue our enemies with unyielding power and purpose we will rush there would be caliphate and counter radical jihadism wherever it takes root were in it for the long haul and will stand taller and stronger than they can possibly imagine thats what we do here thats who we are thats how we will win by looking at one another with respect with concern with commitment thats the america that i know makes us all so proud to be a part of thank you all very muchthank you so much it is really a great delight to be here with olive you and with my fellow candidates i want to congratulate all the inductees and and a thank you for what youre doing to bring back to democratic party and iowa the just look around this room and you can see that democrats are united where energized and we are ready ho way and this election now i know and you do as well that elections are always about the future but this time i feel that even more powerful e maybe its because our country as works so hard to come back from the financial crisis with president obamas leadership and the determination of the american people where standing again the but were not yet running the way america should and now we have to choose whether were going to return to the failed topdown policies that wrecked our economy before or move forward to chart a stronger fairer and more prosperous future now maybe it is the grandmother and made but this is deeply personal theres something about becoming a grand parent it is truly transformational someone you know what im talking about it anchors you in the present and you suddenly have this incredible amazing little person who commands a lot of attention but it also forces you to think about the future in a new way what kind ive world will be waiting for her what kind of country will we have when she becomes an adult and what are our responsibilities to shape that im thinking a lot these days about my own mother and what she did for me abandoned and mistreated by her own family she was out on her own by working as a housemaid but she didnt givin to bitterness or despair and i remember asking her how did you keep your resilience how did you keep your faith in the goodness of people and a future that would be better in the past and heres what she said someone along the way believed she mattered the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and without embarrassing her brought extra food to share the woman whose house she cleaned suggesting she go to high school so long as her work was done and because those people believed in her she was able to believe in me and to give me that great gift a believing in others and in our country so my mom wasnt surprised that my first job out of law school was at the childrens defense fund she wasnt surprised that ive spent my life fighting for women and children families and our country after all thats what she taught me to do and she never stopped pushing me to fight harder for others to have the same opportunities she never had i can still hear her saying lives not about what happens to you its about what you do with what happens to you cell get back out there and thats why im here with you today the thats why im so determined to build a better future catch just for my granddaughter but for all love our children and grandchildren and thats why im never going to let the republicans rip away the progress we have made the you know we democrats are in the future business but from the republican candidates for president we see the opposite now they may have some fresh faces but they are the party up the past we democrats we look at america and we see limitless potential we believe in a basic bargain if you work hard and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead and we believe that the measure up our s should be how much incomes rise for hardworking families not just for ceos and money managers the well republicans believe something very different their answer is always the same cut taxes for the super wealthy let big corporations right their own rules thats it trickledown economics has to be one of the worst ideas up the s the it is right up there with new call shoulder pads and big hair i lived through it and there are photographs and were not going back to that this past monday i laid out an agenda for raising incomes so hard working americans can afford a middleclass life an agenda for strong growth fair growth and longterm growth that will be my mission from the first day im president to the last and this campaign hasta how we unlocked the potential ive every american because bad is how we unlock the potential america itself now im having im having a great debate already with republicans about what that means for our country in the past week governor bush scramble to explain his statement that americans need to work longer hours he now says he just wants part time workers to be able to find fulltime jobs well so do i theres just one problem his policies and the policies are all these republican candidates would make that harder giving more tax cuts to those at the top wont do anything fourpart turner parttime workers rolling back rules for wall street will not help families get ahead and getting red up the affordable care act certainly wont help entrepreneurs just ask the folks in the sharing economy americans dont need lectures they need raises the so if republicans really want to help us why dont they join us in breaking down the barriers so more americans can enter and succeed in the workforce especially women now now i know that when i talk about this some people think i can see it in their eyes there she goes again with the womens issues well im not going to stop so get ready for a long campaign the you see i have this i have this oldfashioned idea we cant afford to leave anyone on the sidelines and women who want to work should be able to do sell without worrying everyday about how theyre going to take care of their child or what will happen if a family member gets sick thats not a luxury its a growth strategy paid bleach earned sick days childcare minimum wage these are not womens issues their family issues and their economic issues the so i will keep fighting for them and ask you to joy and im going to keep fighting for equal pay because when women get shortchanged families get shortchange and when families get shortchanged our economy and our country get shortchanged unlocking potential though goes beyond dollars and cents it really is about our values how we treat each other the kind of country we want to build and that historic day last month when marriage equality became the law of the land republican candidates were complaining not sharing we even her to call for abolishing the supreme court itself instead have trying to turn the clock back republicans should be joining us in saying loudly and clearly knoll to discrimination once and for all lgbt americans should be free not just to marry but to live learn and work just like everybody else the and then theres immigration weve heard a lot recently from the new republican frontrunner donald trump finely a candidate whose hair gets more attention than mine the in but theres nothing funny about the haiti is spewing toward immigrants and their families it really is shameful and so is the fact that it took weeks for most of his fellow republican candidates to stand up to him the sad truth is if you look at many up their policies it is hard to tell the difference just look across the border in wisconsin governor walker kicked off his campaign by rolling back reproductive rights for women and stripping union workers up their rights we dont need anymore politicians who shame and blame women for making our own reproductive health decisions or attacking unions for fighting for middleclass jobs the and and i know there are challenges right here in iowa because youve been talking to me about them just listen to this iowa has fewer than beds for more than aid thousand people in your state with serious mental illnesses families worry about relatives who need help in cant get it and the i ones ive talked to dont understand why your governor would veto a bipartisan compromise without funding a viable alternative and thats not all the government also said no to investing and i was students teachers and schools so tonight im adding my boys to yours governor branstad put down your veto pen the the i love families dont need a standoff they need solutions the thats why we cant wear cascade cascade like theyre trying to do we are not going back to trickledown economics are the wild west on wall street where not going back to insurance companies charging women more for the same coverage were not going back to denying climate change if you ask most of these republican candidates about that theyll say sorry im not a scientist well then why dont they start listening to those who are scientists the look im not a scientist either im just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain and im not gonna let them take us backwards the democrats join me lets build up our party in every corner of this state and country elect democrats at every level take back school boards and statehouses all the way to the white house im running to make our country work for you and for every american for the struggling a striving and the successful for the factory workers in the fold servers who have taken care about us tonight for the back trends have served our country for the farmers will feed us and the small business work owners who take a rest for the nurses who work the night shift in the truckers you drive for hours i am running for everyone whos ever been knocked down but refused to be knocked out im running for you were gonna build america where we dont leave anyone out our anyone behind where view work are you well do your part and get ahead and where a father can tell his daughter yes you can be anything you want to be even president ave oneida stay thank you all very much there answer is always the same cut taxes for the super wealthy let big corporations right their own rules thats it trickledown economics has to be one of the worst ideas up the s it is right up there with new call shoulder pads and big hair i lived through it and there are photographs and were not going back to that this past monday i laid out an agenda for raising incomes so hard working americans can afford a middleclass life an agenda for strong growth fair growth and longterm growth that will be my mission from the first day im president to the last and this campaign hasta how we unlocked the potential ive every american because that is how we unlock the potential america itself now im having im having a great debate already with republicans about what that means for our country in the past week governor bush scramble to explain his statement that americans need to work longer hour he now says he just wants part time workers to be able to find fulltime jobs well so do i theres just one problem his policies and the policies are all these republican candidates would make that harder giving more tax cuts to those at the top wont do anything for part term parttime workers rolling back rules for wall street will not help families get ahead and getting red up the affordable care act certainly wont help entrepreneurs just ask the folks in the sharing economy americans dont need lectures they need raises the so if republicans really want to help us why dont they joining us in breaking down the barriers so more americans can enter and succeed in the workforce especially women now now i know that when i talk about this some people think i can see it in their eyes there she goes again with the womens issues but theres nothing funny about the haiti is spewing toward immigrants and their families it really is shameful and so is the fact that it took weeks for most of his fellow republican candidates to stand up to him the sad truth is if you look at many up their policies it is hard to tell the difference just look across the border in wisconsin governor walker kicked off his campaign by rolling back reproductive rights for women and stripping union workers up their rights we dont need anymore politicians who shame and blame women for making our own reproductive health decisions or attacking unions for fighting for middleclass jobs the and and i know there are challenges right here and i will because youve been talking to me about them just listen to this iowa has fewer than beds for more than aid thousand people in your state with serious mental illnesses families worry about relatives who need help and cant get it and the i ones ive talked to dont understand why your governor would veto a bipartisan compromise without funding a viable alternative and thats not all the government also said no to investing and i was students teachers and schools so tonight im adding my voice to yours governor branstad put down your veto pen the our families dont need a standoff they need solutions the thats why we cant where cascade cascade like theyre trying to do we are not going back to trickledown economics are the wild west on wall street where not going back to insurance companies charging women more for the same coverage were not going back to denying climate change if you ask most of these republican candidates about that theyll say sorry im not assigned well im not going to stop so get ready for a long campaign the you see i have this i have this oldfashioned idea we cant afford to leave anyone on the sidelines and women who want to work should be able to do sell without worrying everyday about how theyre going to take care of their child or what will happen if a family member gets sick thats not a luxury its a growth strategy paid bleach earned sick days childcare minimum wage these are not womens issues their family issues and their economic issues the so i will keep fighting for them and ask you to joy and im going to keep fighting for equal pay because when women get shortchanged families get shortchange and when families get shortchanged our economy and our country get shortchanged unlocking potential though goes beyond dollars and cents it really is about our values how we treat each other the kind of country we want to build and that historic day last month when marriage equality became the law of the land republican candidates were complaining not sharing we even her to call for abolishing the supreme court itself instead trying to turn the clock back republicans should be joining us in saying loudly and clearly knoll to discrimination once and for all lgbt americans should be free not just to marry but to live learn and work just like everybody else the and then theres immigration weve heard a lot recently from the new republican frontrunner donald trump finely a candidate whose hair gets more attention than mine the in they believed she mattered the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and without embarrassing her brought extra food to share the woman whose house she cleaned suggesting she go to high school so long as her work was done and because those people believed in her she was able to believe in me and to give me that great gift a believing in others and in our country so my mom wasnt surprised that my first job out of law school was at the childrens defense fund she wasnt surprised that ive spent my life fighting for women and children families and our country after all thats what she taught me to do and she never stopped pushing me to fight harder for others to have the same opportunities she never had i can still hear her saying lives not about what happens to you its about what you do with what happens to you cell get back out there and dats why im here with you today the thats why im so determined to build a better future attack just for my granddaughter but for all love our children and grandchildren and thats why im never going to let the republicans rip away the progress we have made the you know we democrats are in the future business but from the republican candidates for president we see the opposite now they may have some fresh faces but they are the party up the past we democrats we look at america and we see limitless potential we believe in a basic bargain if you work hard and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead and we believe that the measure up our s should be how much incomes rise for hardworking families not just for ceos and money managers the well republicans believe something very different thank you all thank you so much it is really a a great delight to be here with olive you and with my fellow candidates i want to congratulate all the inductees and and a thank you for what youre doing to bring back the democratic party and iowa the just look around this room and you can see that democrats are united where energized and we are ready ho way and this election now i know and you do as well that elections are always about the future but this time i feel that even more powerful e maybe its because our country as works so hard to come back from the financial crisis with president obamas leadership and the determination of the american people where standing again but were not yet running the way america should and now we have to choose whether were going to return to the failed topdown policies that wrecked our economy before or move forward to chart a stronger fairer and more prosperous future now maybe it is the grandmother and made but this is deeply personal theres something about becoming a grand parent it is truly transformational someone you know what im talking about it anchors you in the present and you suddenly have this incredible amazing little person who commands a lot of attention but it also forces you to think about the future in a new way what kind ive world will be waiting for her what kind of country will we have when she becomes an adult and what are our responsibilities to shape that im thinking a lot these days about my own mother and what she did for me abandoned and mistreated by her own family she was out on her own by working as a housemaid but she didnt givin to bitterness or despair and i remember asking her how did you keep your resilience how did you keep your faith in the goodness of people and a future that would be better in the past and heres what she said someone along the wayon this beautiful day out in the sunshine historic setting the first president of the united states that ever came here untold was george washington had a lot to do with leading our country and forming it and i am so proud that you have as your governor a great leader like terry mcauliffe shy and retiring job but i think theres a real lesson not only in what he did when he ran for your governorship but when he has served for you he set out a progressive agenda he laid out very clearly what he wanted to do and then i got to work doing it in addition to all of the promises he made that he has cap he has continued with enthusiasm and energy to drive a lift up the people of the commonwealth hes not trying to divide people and set them against each other as he is trying to bring people together to get better jobs and rising incomes and make sure the children of virginia get the health care they need the nutrition that they need a great team i wanna thank dick saslaw the democratic leader in the virginia state senator is here gunfire whose district we are in all the elected officials have a big election coming up in june weeks and it really matters that you come out and vote because it will determine how much more terry can get done in the years remaining in his term hes already as he said helped to drive down the unemployment rate create and bring more jobs to virginia think of what he could do for you if he had partners in the state senate and the statehouse i think everybody for coming out here today but i especially thank the veterans the activeduty servicemembers the military families who are representing here today i know a lot of you are taking time out from your job and your families to be here and i really appreciate it because you know how important this election is its going to have a big impact on the future for us for our families and for our country and were facing a very stark choice either were going to build on the progress weve made under president obama gonna give republicans another chance to tear down everything weve worked so hard to bill i know that republicans would rather have us forget but i remember when president obama came into office he was facing the worst financial crisis since the great depression i remember meeting with me call me shortly after the election asked me to come to chicago i didnt know why at the time turned out he wanted me to be as secretary of state which i was very first part of our conversation talking about how bad things were here it was this new young dynamic president and the republicans on the way out the door hey by the way were losing jobs a month the auto industry is on the brink of collapse taken millions more jobs with it and presidentelect obama said you know it so much worse than they told us he got to work and weve come a long way i dont think president obama gets the credit he deserves for letting us out of that great recession economy from what could have been a great depressions a rescue the auto industry he began to crack down on wall street abuses and on top of that he helped eighteen million more americans get health insurance through the airport so i agree with what vice president biden said the other day in the rose garden democrats should be proud of that record of a chain men and women should have been elections about the future isnt it and theres a lot more work that has to be done president obama vice president biden would be the first to say that and i know theyll both feet fighting the fight that they have been committed to after they leave office but when i look at what we have to do im filled with excitement and optimism im not running for president obamas third term im not running for bill clintons thirdterm im running for my first their records should make democrats proud and they should make americans proud i spent the first part of this campaign traveling across our country listening to people i visited folks in their homes schools businesses and i listened i listened as they told me about their lives the good the bad its amazing when you run for office if you actually listen people will open their hearts to you they will tell you things that maybe their family members or their neighbors certainly dont know and heres what ive heard people feel like after six and a half years of hard work and sacrifice america is standing again but were not running yet the way we should for most people paychecks havent budged in years the minimum wage should be called when it is a poverty wage many women yes till many women are paid less than men for doing the same were and women of color earn even less just this week the department of labor released new data showing that as our economy gets stronger mens pay is going up more than twice as fast as womens pay meanwhile the cost of everything from college to prescription drugs keeps going up in a quality is a huge problem in america and we cannot go back to the policies that actually made it worse in the nineteen nineties at the end of two terms of my husband we had not only million new jobs we had incomes rising for everybody the ranch middle class working folks the poor everybody was getting ahead look at whats happening now and why is that its because we havent focused on what the central economic issue is how do we get incomes rising again and how do we begin to rein in the costs that are such a burden just so many americans look at the way student debt is weighing people down million americans have student debt how many of you in this crowd have student death ive got a plan to the two could refinance it and get out from under that student debt and get on with your lives to be productive in the economy and listen to this in many states quality child care is more expensive than college tuition how honors our families particularly single mother families single father families how on earth are they going to be able to do their jobs and take care of their kids went on president thats why ive made a high priority of us achieving paid family lane only advanced economy with no program and when people ask me about it and they say well how can we do this i said well you know californias had a program for a while other states are finally coming around it will really help middle class and working families and we still havent pass comprehensive immigration reform which has brought out some of the worst republican candidates running for president running for president because after listening to people across our country your fight are my fights and i wont quit until all americans have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead again things have been said about me but twitter is not one of them help middleclass families get that raised in to fight for small businesses that create most of the jobs in america to make sure that when a company does well its not just the shareholders and executives who benefit its also the people who work at that company they should be able to share in the profits of that company and im running not only to make life a little easier for working parents but to close that wage gap because women deserve fair pay you know the other day yesterday in new hampshire young man came up to me probably mid twenties he said i want to tell you i am for you i said please thank you my first real job when i was i went to work as a cashier in a store near where i live it was a story of my mother was already working as a cashier and she had raised me by yourself i was really proud of short sleeve white shirt and a tie i went to work in that store first payday i bring my check home and i show my mother always said i see this look on her face i said whats wrong she said you know they started you at a dollar more an hour they pay me after four years doin the same job i did have a little girl at a town hall of nevada i love calling on the kids in these town halls you never know what theyre gonna send a little girl got the microphone she looked at me she goes if youre a girl president the same amount of money as a boy president so checked it lately but i think so you know what we have to make sure that everyone in america has access to quality affordable health care and i want to applaud again for governor because hes been waging a really important fight here in the commonwealth of these issues where ideology trumps evidence to states that have expanded medicaid fully paid for in the beginning by the federal government theyve actually seen insurance rates drop theyve been able to keep rural and smalltown hospitals open and theyve been able to take care of hundreds and hundreds of millions of people and yet here in virginia despite the evidence ideology basically has clouded the calculation and so terry has been struggling with his legislature to do what is not only good for the people who would get health care but good for everybody applauded him again for taking on this site quality affordable health care in addition to having a plan so that you can refinance your student debt i wanna put college within the reach of more people again has gone up more than anything else in the last years plans so that if you go to a fouryear public college or university you will not have to borrow money for tuition and if you do national service if you go into a service profession after you finish you have even a better deal because its not right that hardworking talented young people are unable to get the education they are pursuing because they cannot afford it that its not the america we want for our children and our grandchildren in all of these fights to make sure the republicans dont privatize social security make sure they dont demonize hardworking immigrants we are going to run a campaign that s all of you to be part of doing what we need to reach out to as many of your friends and neighbors as possible because we want to run this campaign on a real agenda just like terry did i want the american people to know exactly what i will do from the first hour after i am sworn in i cant do this without your help and thats one of the reasons why im so thrilled to see all of you here in virginia because virginia will vote on march st and that of course is our most fundamental right as americans isnt it the right to vote states try to make it hard for people to vote young people people with disabilities the elderly people of color i want you to be able to vote no matter who you vote for of course i want your vote but as your president i will fight any effort to disenfranchise any american any where to protect our families and communities from the plague of gun violence heartbreaking and infuriating that we lose an average of americans every day because of guns and no matter what anybody says this is not an urban problem the problem and small towns and suburbs on college campuses in movie theaters even in the basement of a church i want to publicly thank your governor for signing an executive order that prohibits the open carry of guns in state government buildings and also for creating a task force to better prosecute gun crimes that is the kind of sensible reform we should all be able to get behind in fact we know that the majority of americans and the majority of gun owners agree with us on this now ive been told to stop shouting about guns actually i havent been shouting but sometimes when a woman talks some people think but i wont be silenced and i hope you wont be either i will be speaking out and i will keep taking on the nra bag question for responsible gun owners has to be how many more people have to die before we take action and i would love to see gun owners start a competing organization the nra basically represents the manufacturers and the sellers and one of the most outrageous votes that i ever had to take when i was in the senate was a nra bill to give immunity to gun manufacturers and sellers for just about everything it was unique no other industry in america has anything like it and its basically an nra gift to gun manufacturers and gun sellers its wrong and we have to stand against it and we have to fight to repeal it everybody in this country should be responsible and accountable for their actions and that includes gun manufacturers gun sellers and the nra now i think i think these are all fights worth taking odd and i am ready with your help to do that as i said the other night at the debate ima progressive a progressive who likes to get things done and yeah i know how to find common ground i did it in the senate i get it as secretary of state i will certainly do it as president i will go anywhere any time to meet with anybody to find common ground but i also know how to stand my ground and you deserve you deserve a nominee and a president with the solutions and the determination to actually make a difference in your lives and in our countrys future so we have a lot of work ahead of us my friends because there are people out there was a very different vision for our country and thats worthy of a great debate and there are the allies of those on the other side who will say do and spend whatever it takes to advance their own out of touch out of date agenda so heres my promise to you other candidates may be out there hurling insults at everyone talking about whats wrong with america wanting to divide us i still believe there is nothing wrong with america they cant beat building whats right with america either make sure our country has one where we lift each other up and leave no one behind i am grateful for the hundreds of thousands of grassroots activists who are joining this campaign the veterans and workers the students the teachers that parents or grandparents across our country and im especially proud of the women who are supporting my campaign in record numbers these days about the super pacs and the billionaire mega donors but a lot of people dont realize my campaign is being built by small donors capo giving whatever they can afford over of my donations come from donors giving or less and i have some great news as of today more than people have done donated to my campaign and were increasing that number because at the end of this campaign doesnt belong to me it belongs to you and to the millions of americans we are fighting for and that we want to be a part of it so whether youve ever been involved in campaign before whether youve ever voted before there is a place for you not just in my campaign but when we win and we began the hard work to make sure our country lives up to our hopes and dreams theres something you can do right now text join j go to hillary clinton dot com for more information talk to your friends your colleagues your neighbors talk to them about how important this election is to our future you know every day that i get out on the campaign trail theres a lot that motivates me ill need somebody who has a story to tell heres something that really gets me energized sometimes even more motivated than i was the day before but what i think about all the time is my granddaughter and the reason i do is because for those of you who are grandparents you know that it just focuses your mind unlike anything else that youve ever experienced obviously bill and i are gonna do everything we can to make sure our granddaughter has whatever opportunities she could possibly want in her life thats not enough im the granddaughter of a factory worker from scranton pennsylvania grandfather went to work in the straightlaced mills worked hard for so many years so that he could give his sons about her life and he do all three of his sons went to college my father became a small businessman after serving in the navy in world war two just whats going to happen to my granddaughter but the kids in our country what kind of america will be inherit what kind of world will be waiting for them because you see i dont think you should have to be the grand daughter of a former president to be able to claim the promise of america i think you shouldnt be able to be the granddaughter a factory worker the grandson of a truck driver or any child in this country should have a good health care in the education and the opportunities to make the most out of his or her godgiven potential thats what im gonna fight for a country that opens doors again for everyone and where every father can save his daughter you can be anything you want including president of the united you are and we all know that the republican agenda set back womens rights and i pledge all my energy to a job big victory for democrats across the country and we do have a winning message of building a strong middle class investing in education infrastructure extending health coverage to more and more americans granting a path to citizenship to those whove lived in the shadows for too long accepting the child science of climate change and having the leadership to cut back on fossil fuel consumption with sound policy we defend our civil liberties and and having leadership to cut back on fossil fuel consumption with sound policy we defend our civil liberties and womens reproductive freedoms we respect the rights of lgbt friends understand black lights matter that we do need to do more for native americans and most of all you can be sure that democrats will make good appointments to the supreme court something this country needs and deserves now she may not have been campaigning on a platform of prosperity through peace but after much thought i decided to end my campaign for the president today thank you but i would like to take this opportunity one last time to advocating for a chance be given to peace since today is all about womens leadership reminds me of one of my favorite greek place this estrada a comedy from bc by aristophanes now in that play a group of women had up with the warmongering of their husbands agreed to and how do i say this appropriately withhold their favors until peace returns and it worked the end of the peloponnesian wars anyway lets talk about the present study showed that women tend to read differently than men and that women are more likely to be collaborative and teamoriented undeniable the benefits women provide to the pursuit of peace now when i was a senator a general from the pentagon testified before the foreign relations committee on global military powers and i asked him who was second to the united states in military might and he thought for a bit and then he said probably the uk and yes there was a few years ago but the point remains true no real rival to the united states exist when it comes to total weaponry and we make virginiaclass submarines around and ive been on an overnight patrol what a phenomenal piece of technology and craftsmanship and machine bristling with the most advanced power imaginable and some reason just one instrument and are staggeringly efficient arsenal war and yes we are sinking ever deeper and deeper into an endless morass in the middle east and north africa people keep dying in peace seems further and further away its evident that all this military power isnt working for us right now story from danang vietnam deny that city has so many memories from my generation but just this summer warmer viacom index american gizz were laughing eating drinking and celebrating the fourth of july together and the article quoted pete peterson a former air force pilot who spent six and a half years in a hand or a prison camp after he was shot down and later he served as ambassador to vietnam in the nineteen nineties and he said now vietnam the united states have so much in common ill after all the horror of that war why did we do it he was asked and he said i have thought about this for a long time im convinced that the war could have been averted had we made the effort to understand the politics of the place had we made the effort to understand the politics of the place leasing gentleman from what ive heard none of the republicans running for president want to understand anything about the middle east and north africa instead they prefer more bellicose see more saberrattling and more macho posturing when i hear all the stuff talk i had deja voo about the evil viacom we should be different democrats should insist and learning from the lessons of vietnam could have been averted no im not saying that all countries are right in any particular thing they do we must hold them accountable but we cant do that if we dont hold ourselves accountable and change our entire paradigm united states is so strong militarily economically culturally that we must take chances for peace militarily economically culturally that we must take chances for peace if we have courage we take risks we can have prosperity through peace not just the united states but all over the world do we want to be remembered as a bomber of weddings in hospitals and we will be remembered as peacemakers as pioneers of a more harmonious world if american war veterans in viet cong fighters can laugh together on the fourth of july oh so to answer iranian sandras raileys shias and sunnis turks and kurds no wise men president eisenhower counseled us that only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry ensure the proper meshing of both security and liberty so its up to you women citizens humans to demand from your leaders and end to the endless wars in the beginning of a new era for the united states and humanity thank you go democrats and womens forum hosted by the dnc dnc president obama just beginning to speak to the group live coverage here on c span to strengthen this party up and down the ballot in all states that are chair debbie wasserman schultz debbies couldnt be here today because shes working to build up our party in tennessee she is relentless shes got incredible partners in the ceo of the dnc everyday see where they me shes around here somewhere giving me a big round of applause she and the womens leadership forum cofounders cynthia freemen and carol penn state so it is good to see all of you many of you have been friends for a long time and then theres some of you who were when i first ran for the presidency which is not like i was the point though is that all of you are working hard to make sure that our party and our country moves forward and for the younger people here let me refresh your memory when we came together seven years ago we did so not just elected president but to reaffirm our faith and that most fundamental basic american idea that people who love this country and changing lot of you were involved in that movement lot of you statement ever since and that faith has sometimes been tested by war and recession and by politics and by obstruction and by a lot of cynics who said it was foolish russell keep believing that i was naive for us to keep on trying but thanks to folks like you thanks to americans like you this country is moving forward i made judges think i think about the path we travel but yes well when i took off this we were lost jobs and unemployment rate was on its way to today during the course of the longest streak of job growth on record our businesses have created million new jobs unemployment is now percent of americans without health insurance today weve covered another seventeen million americans for the first time on record more than ninety percent of americans have coverage for everybody who are had coverage now insurance companies can discriminate because of a preexisting condition or charge women more just for being a woman when i took office we were hopelessly addicted to foreign oil weve cut our oil imports by half we have double the production of clean energy triple the amount of wind power we generate twenty times more solar energy is now created then when i came into office and all thats generating good jobs can be outsourced and helping the environment when i took office our influence around the world was animator are standing was diminished today americas leading the world in confronting new threats making sure iran doesnt get a nuclear weapon americas leading the world in global action on climate change americas leading the world to rights smarter and stronger trade rules for the st century weve begun a new chapter of engagement with the cuban people we have brought thousands of our brave troops home to me when theyre brave families so weve made incredible progress on just about every punch you you cant find a part of our economic life where we havent seen significant progress but we come here today because we know we still got work to do we cant just be complacent weekend rest on our laurels cynics told us we couldnt change this country they were wrong but we know we still got work to do marriage equality is now a reality but weve still got work to do to make sure that our lgbt community is getting fair treatment on the job high school graduation rates are up and college graduation rates are up but we still have to help young people be able to go to college without burden and being burdened by a mountain of debt being burdened by amount of debt is up but we still have to do more to make sure that were training our folks to get these new manufacturing jobs are deficits are down but we gotta make sure that we are making the investments that we need to grow in the future are carbon pollution is down but were not moving as fast as we need to control climate change teen pregnancy rates are down but weve got a lot of folks were attacking the right of women just to have basic health care in this country and be able to make decisions about reproductive freedom without having some member of congress some governor some other elected officials tried and true but the point is over although were making enormous progress and and and it does make you wonder why is it the republican politicians are so down on america have you noticed that there are gloomy according to the political season but you you listen to him and and they were constructed this entire separate reality like the twilight zone and according to their their story their narrative everything was trippin back in when unemployment skyrocketing an uninsured rates were rising and folks were losing their homes and their jobs and we are engaged in two wars and bin laden was still at large if you were listening to them both were like the good old days ago in news and then i came in and the democrats thats when everything which is strange i mean its a hard argument to make there was an article in the new york times today or maybe it was yesterday when they pointed out that its very hard for them to make the arguments they make about tax cuts for the wealthy and doing the same stuff that theyve been promoting and trying to eliminate regulations on the big banks know that when the empirical evidence shows that when democrats control the white house and weve got a democratic congress the economy was better and when theyre in charge it does work i made just look at the facts dont take my word for it go back take a look at alright heres bill clintons presidency and then theres bush presidency and theres my presidency and take a look and you gotta feel bad for the fact checkers for the republicans spent hours trying to keep up with some of the crazy stuff that their candidates are claiming and the reason that the makeup stuff is because they dont have a record to run off their offering the same policies that caused so many problems in the first place they ran on them in they ran on the the running on the net more tax cuts for the folks at the very top although there is no economic evidence to show that that would grow the economy they say thats going to grow the economy nobody believes that no economist think it but they insist on your investments and things like education even though there is no evidence that would actually improve the lives of the american people theres a lot of evidence it would make it worse they want to repeal the affordable care act which i know is a shop shopping development millions of hardworking americans offer health insurance theyve been promising since we passed that they would replace it with something better except they cant come up with anything accepted just happy for him wall street reform and risk another crisis by letting the big banks running while they may want to strip away rate regulations on polluters prices by the big banks run while they may want to strip away rate regulations on polluters saying that these are job killers despite the fact is i already pointed out that point out that job growth happens on your democratic administrations and was worse under their administrations and may even deny that the plant is getting warmer and wetter climates more dangerous and this despite evidence to the contrary they are fighting tooth and nail to unravel new rules on power plants to protect the air that our kids breathing reduce harmful carbon carbon emissions and and i think what the way they approach climate change is a good illustration of the problems went you are really sick youve got lots of high cholesterol what would you do what would you say those doctors are a crazy and part of a wild eyed socialist plot to prevent you from eating cheese or what you say you know what about those doctors know what theyre talking about gotta modify my download it made me laugh but this thats essentially how theyre approaching this existential threat to our future and the truth is a majority of republican voters disagree with their own party on this report washington republicans are long on on their own shrinking island so the point is what number one we got a lot of things to feel good about this country and its a shame when politicians spend all their time trying to make people feel bad or more typically try to make them feel scared talking down the country all the time because it serves your politics we dont have time for that weve got more work to do and democrats are the one with the right ideas to write plans to get the job done weve got weve got weve got an optimistic got an optimistic vision about where this country can go in if the politics of obstruction and fear mongering are set aside and if we start working together as a country theres no problem we can solve you heard from somewhere outstanding candidates im gonna be supporting whoever the nominee isnt and im confident what are you laughing about it got some great candidate but when you watched the debate between the democratic it was logical and civil and people dont agree with everything but they werent just saying crazy stuff and and and they werent dividing the country into us and them and tapping into peoples worst impulses it made me proud because it it said that weve got a part of its inclusion and wants everybody to join and get involved and showed but we can disagree without being disagreeable as democrats are economic plants would actually grow the economy for everybody not just for folks at the top we we should not even be thinking about something as ridiculous as shutting down our government over planned parenthood we should be talking about opening up new opportunities investing in our school rebuilding the infrastructure that creates jobs investing in the research that alleviate hunger or cures cancer once and for all vice president joe biden said spending time thinking about the concrete challenges that families face so we have family leave plans were actually guarantee familyleave plans to raise peoples wages rather than trying to suppress peoples wages are plans to make sure that women are paid fairly for doing the same work plan to make sure that women are paid fairly for doing the same work or not against a law that would make sure women are paid fairly for doing the same work as many as democrats are plans to combat climate change actually recognize the existence of climate change and its not just a matter of trying to solve a problem albert danger its we see opportunity and jobs and moving to a clean energy economy we want america to be out front we embrace our responsibilities to leave our kids with a safe prosperous habitable planet as democrats are proud that our plans to fix our broken immigration system are not rooted in anti immigrant immigrant stories we understand that americas greatness doesnt come from building walls it comes from building up opportunities now the good news is that theres a broad consensus within our party about what needs to happen and whats also good news is the majority of american people agree with us but theres a danger coming up and its something that were gonna have to address and that is complacency and cynicism and a lot of times it seems like our politics dont reflect the common sense and decency that we see in our neighbors and our communities and our friends and it gets frustrating weve got a system that too often rewards division and polarization and shortterm thinking and rewards people for saying the most outrageous things even though everyone knows theyre not true but we think of it as entertainment somehow so attentiongrabbing and controversy is rewarded rather than folks rolling up their sleeves and dealing with sometimes really complicated issues that dont lend themselves to a samba and so people get cynical and sometimes folks just throw up their hands and say washington doesnt work a plague on both your houses everybodys dysfunctional your job is to not succumb to make your job more important is to convince your friends and your neighbors in your communities to states not to succumb to that we cant afford that weve got too much work to do our system only works when we realize the government is not some alien thing government is not some conspiracy or plot its not something to impress you government sauce in a democracy government is us the most important office in democracy is the office of citizen its you and and business been the promise of my politics since since we got to know each other since i started running i i always have to remind people when i ran for office i didnt say i got this go home i dont say yes i can depend on me or congress or the democratic president that we intend to elect next year alone it depends on all of us it depends on what we the people do together and thats why im so glad to see these young people here this fancy ballroom and schmoozing and listen to the president this is easy comment fancy ballroom and schmoozing and listen to the president we need we need you to go on organized mobilize when you get a knock on doors when you get to work on referendums on the ballot initiative to work at the local level and at the state level when you get in for people of all people you need to turn them out to vote we gotta make sure that your friends across the country know where their leader stand and if they dont know then inform them and make sure theyre doing the right thing and hold them accountable if theyre not doing the right thing we gotta vote him out and america is at its best assume the best enough instead of the bad one more run to try and recognize our own struggles and fears and hopes and other people and we see some kids struggling to pay for college we have to feel like thats our kids or or i remember how how i had to struggle when when when you see it hoping to contribute that thats my parents or grandparents greatgrandparents that africanamerican denied right to vote you understand democracy is at stake when that happens workers denied a living wage or equal paper her efforts that hurts everybody their stories may not be exactly like ours but when the same fight we care about the same things we believe in each other and thats what makes me proud to be a democrat we are right on most policy issues arguments are the right ones but a dark or what i am really proud of is the fact that we believe in this country that everybody has a fair shot that everybodys gotta gotta be able to get ahead that that weve got a responsibility to uphold those highest ideals to fight for everybody who have the same chances that we have and lead a country to our kids where no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love you can make it if you try thats what we stand for as democrats thats thats what the next years election thats why i get bitthose are the words of senator robert kennedy and also the words which i had lived by my entire life my name is john carrolls im years old and im a graduate of the university of south florida global nobody is junk is there soon if im proud to be here to introduce a person who has fought for the working class and especially hispanic families her entire life i think that the secretary clinton has decided to run for president because she and president bill clinton other reasons why im a democrat i think is because of the memory i have of the presidential election of i was just a young boy then but i can remember my parents watching the election results there was a big map on on the screen and the united states we had blue states and red states and blue states in red states and then the announcement came through that president clinton had been elected to a second term in a great joy and great joy and happiness come from my parents and it surprised me because my parents were not become you as citizens for many years after that but their joy and happiness in encino president elected that they could not vote for their happiness is a result of the clinton policies that created million jobs that left the massive surplus in the federal budget that guided our country the longest peacetime since the cold war because of the achievements of the clinton white house and because of the achievements of then senator clinton i supported her in and i am aesthetic to support her in her bid for the white house in and as much as i love president bill clinton its time to elect the woman to the white house more qualified than hillary rodham clinton casablanca monthly stopped by a lot i think yes my friends weve made a lot of progress is creating millions of jobs stabilizing the you s economy fighting terrorism abroad and at home and providing millions of americans access to affordable health care but yet there is much work to be done so now is not the time to give back the keys to the white house through the clouds show of extremist know my friends now is the time for strong and experienced leadership that can only be given to us by hillary rodham clinton graduate i can tell you colleges it really is a part of the process of a teeny a college education hillary clinton understands the struggle everyday college students everyday college graduates thats why support her plan to help refinance college college loans and find new ways to reinvest in college educated in a college education i also have under hillary clintons leadership we will finally have comprehensive immigration reform in the united states millions of undocumented immigrants the opportunity to citizenship and with the fear of deportation of families i also know that she will find common sense solutions to the financial depression that our brothers and sisters are facing today and that thats why brings me great delight in a great pleasure to introduce to you the next president of the united states already appeared before you starspangled banner and people who understand whats at stake in this election this is my fourth trip to florida in the campaign reason for coming is not just the weather ur its because florida is so much a symbol of america diverse dynamic optimistic you have everything in this state from big cities just small towns from highrises to family farms and the diversity of the people here in florida send such a strong message about the importance of us always valuing the fact we are a nation of immigrants and we need to understand that and support it now like america florida is always changing and certainly here in central florida weve seen so many people come here for the jobs for the opportunities summer even started to call central florida puerto ricos municipality well i went to puerto rico in september because i believe anyone who wants to be president should give attention to puerto rico and jen remind our fellow americans puerto ricans are american citizens and it is one of the great ironies of our law in our history that porter ricans who are citizens in puerto rico cannot vote for their president and commanderinchief but if you moved to central florida because youre a citizen you can vote and what we need to recognize is that theres much we can do if we are supporting our puerto rican friends its great but today there is a national day of action for porto rico happening on capitol hill we have to find a longterm solution to the economic and health care challenges facing porto rico and everyone here with ties to the island you have to help us be part of the solution youre engagement and support will really matter bc i think we are all in this together and i am proud to be running for president to make our country and our economy work for everyone not just those at the top republican friends are not happy about but i try to stay factual to demonstrate john was saying our economy does so much better when we have a democrat in the white and you know unemployment is lower incomes are higher and you are four times more likely to have a recession we have a republican in the white house now you dont have to go back hundreds of years lets just go back thirty five years weve had five presidents three republicans and two democrats i happen to know both of the democrats and age of the democrats inherited economic problems from their republican predecessors in my husbands case he inherited a recession and the depth of our country had been quadrupled in the prior twelve years i remember bill telling me after the election said it so much worse than they told us and he was asked in the weeks after he was elected to what is it you bring to washington and he said well i guess arithmetic we began adding and subtracting multiplying and dividing and after eight years we did end up with million new jobs but most importantly incomes rose for everybody not just those at the top of the medal table and more people are lifted out of poverty than any time in our recent history and we did end up with a balanced budget and a surplus now one would think with that record of success the republicans might say to themselves maybe we should build on that but thats not what the next republican president decided to do as we well recall he began to dismantle economic policy literally brick by brick off what was happening in the economy cut taxes for the wealthy got out of the way of corporations ignored the mortgage market problems and you know where we ended up in fact florida you didnt just lived through a great recession you had a greater recession the whole was deeper it took you longer to climb out now republicans do want us to have a case of collective amnesia its very inconvenient when we point out that their trickledown economic ideology doesnt work and will not work in fact i remember after the election president elect obama called asked me to come see him i dont know why i went to chicago turned out he wanted me to be secretary of state but before we got that its just he and i he says to me it is so much worse than they told us i said you know what ive heard that before and this time it was even worse the worst economic crisis since the great depression i want you to remember this because when you leave here today and you talk to friends or neighbors or colleagues and see what were you doing there i want you to say well im supporting the next president of the united states because shes gonna get the economy working when president came into office we were losing jobs a month million americans ended up losing their jobs five million homes were lost a lot of them right here in florida thirteen trillion dollars of family well homes cars retirement savings college funds wiped out i dont think president obama gets the credit he deserves for saving us from falling into a great depression that was done by the republicans people are even got there again weve recovered million jobs weve seen sixty eight straight months of job growth manufacturing coming back the auto industry which was on the brink of total collapse was saved its coming back so were standing but were not yet running america should have been traveling across our country and ive been doing a lot of listening ive heard from families about the stress of the bills piling up of caring for an aging parent a child suffering from substance abuse or a loved one with mental illness about how the cost of everything college and prescription drugs and childcare are all going up faster than wages and too many young people as john said being crushed by student debt and many of them unable to start or finish college because of the cost so weve got some work to do now im not running for my husbands thirdterm and im not running for barack obamas third term im running for my first term but were gonna get to work create goodpaying jobs in the future where your wages rise not your texts where it is easier to pay for child care kids to college paper your prescription drugs take care of your aging parents those should not be luxuries you should get the help you need to get those jobs and to get that support so that you can live the kind of american dream we all believe in and i am working and fighting for an america where everyone who works hard has a ladder of opportunity again you know i was raised in the basic bargain of america you should be able to im going to do everything in my power as your president to make that bargain real again by providing more early childhood education and preschool so every kid gets a good start when they show up in kindergarten and i do have a plan where you go to a public college or university you will not have to borrow a dime to page and you will be able to refinance your student how many people have student debt look at those hands how many ever had student debt i did tell you why we have one point two trillion dollars in student debt that is really holding back so many people ive met young people who cant get out on their own cant afford to move out of their parents home after they get their college degree get married because they cant afford it we have got to get college affordable again and get that debt down to save you thousands of dollars as you vote for were fighting for an america that leads with strength and smarts keeping our people safe and defeating the terrorist networks that threaten us and we lift each other up again where we have each others backs because when families are strong america is strong that means keeping families together that means giving them are real path to citizenship it means an end to discrimination against lgbt americans womens health and womens rights and standing up law enforcement and the communities they serve and it means helping americans struggling with addiction and end up in recovery not in prison americans outline is supported by of american and more importantly eightythree percent of gun owners support that agenda because they want to be responsible and not let guns fall into the wrong hands now we are hearing a lot of different things are away from the republicans running for president they seem more interested in seeing who can say the most in offensive and insulting comments youve heard what theyve said they have insulted latinos women muslims they determine to absolutely and sought after a body before this is over there out tramping truck if you will why i am so honored that latino leaders like ricky martin are standing with me in this campaign making the hallmarks of his campaign when it called immigrants rapists and drug dealers when he shouted down and demanded jorge ramos stop doing his job ricky martin clinton let it go by what he stood up and he brought back he said we have to fight for every right we have today and demand respect well i am with you rikki were gonna ride had a man with about how were going to create goodpaying jobs and im just going to keep talking and explain to you what it is im gonna do ok and im really glad to have representatives from our construction trade here today men and women will america were going to create good jobs and rising wages by once again investing in our infrastructure i have laid out a five year two hundred and seventy five billion dollar plan and florida is the gateway for trade with latin america its a huge market so lets rebuild and invest in the infrastructure we have you know just think about this we have so many roads and bridges that are powered hold and crumbling here in orlando commuters lose forty six hours a year stuck in traffic you know this is not just about good jobs for hardworking men and women this is about time and money we are wasting i hope that congress finally passes a longterm highway bill this week here in florida your highways have for the biggest traffic bottlenecks in the country that should be fixed but even if congress wont do the right thing i am prepared with my plan to really began to do what we need to do we have to expand our commitment to building and maintaining our infrastructure because its a competitive necessity you know in this country we dont have one of the top airports in america in fact the closest we get is cincinnati has number thirty we also have to expand new hightech and for structure and that means connecting everybody in america to have access to highspeed internet right now we dont have that we know how to do this we did it with electricity and were gonna do it again and dont forget all the infrastructure under the ground water mains sewer systems gas lines weve got to also invest in bringing those up to speed as well i have a comprehensive strategy to upgrade our energy infrastructure to expand solar and energy efficiency boast an energy technology and especially here in florida we have to make this state and our communities across america resilient to climate change you know look all of the republicans say the same thing you know when theyre asked about climate change they say well i dont know im not a scientist well my answer to that is go talk to a scientist and actually listen to a science and a projection about florida demonstrates how vulnerable this state is to climate change in fact down in miami were already seeing streets that flood at high tide on sunny days drinking water wells around the state are being inundated with salt water becoming unusable and thats all without a major hurricane hitting in recent years so anybody who doesnt take climate change seriously just needs to be convinced that they have to get out of the way because were going to create jobs create many many new businesses and began to fight back against climate change when i am president and we can on the sidelines thats why i want to create a new national infrastructure bank i want to bring back what are called build america bonds that was a successful program that helps cities and states borrow the money they needed to invest in infrastructure at lower costs and it did a lot of good across america we have to use every tool at our disposal and were gonna make a real difference together now its sort of sad to me because when i was a senator we had no problem getting democrats and republicans coming together to invest and understand the importance of infrastructure now weve got republican candidate for president who want to slash what we spend by ted cruz has supported legislation to do that and i really i really dont understand it marco rubio followed right along he wants to funding and those people who say will let the states do it do you really want to put responsibility for funding floridas infrastructure in the hands of rick scott you know this but he said two billion dollars back to washington that would have been spent on infrastructure right here in florida tell that story guys let people know that could have created goodpaying jobs and spurred economic growth you have to wonder about governor scotts priorities florida is called the sunshine state for a reason florida is lagging behind in solar power and i hate to tell you this states like massachusetts and new jersey are years ahead theres no reason that should be true and on top of that governor scott still refuses to expand medicaid theres no excuse for that either i dont mean to be a little parochial here but arkansas expanded medicaid alabamas republican governors talking seriously about expanding medicaid the incoming governor of louisiana is making this a top priority just sayin florida its not only the right thing to do for people who deserve to have their health care needs met its good for rural hospitals its good for doctors nurses and other healthcare providers and we need to make sure that we provide the support for the affordable care act were gonna have to improve it yes that cost down get prescription drug prices down so you can see i can keep going but i know youve been more than patient here at what i want to ask you all is to join my campaign you know florida is so important we see that time and time again well number one i need your help in the primary so dont just come tonight make sure your registered to vote make sure you do about on march the first in fact i want you to join the campaign right now and heres how you can do it take out your phone i know you all have phones and text join j to get involved right now thats join j because even though my name will be on the ballot this election is really about you about finding the solutions to the challenges we face together getting back into problemsolving where americans are better at that than anybody else in the world i gotta tell you what really gets me up every day is my belief so soundly in the promise of america my grandfather was a factory worker he came to this country as a young immigrant with his family and he went to work in the scranton laced mills in scranton pennsylvania and they work really hard to support his family but also because he believed in the promise of america that his sons could get ahead and they did every one of them went to college and when my dad graduated in the middle of the great depression in he couldnt find a job so we hopped a freight train these to do that in those days and you got all the way to chicago and he found a job he was a salesman and he went into the navy where he was a chief petty officer and then when he came out he started a small business now my mother had a very different life she was abandoned and rejected by her own family and sent to live with grandparents who didnt wander over the age of she was out working as a housemaid and somebody elses home to support herself so even though their lives were very very different they both believed that life would get better for them and for their children in our country thats what i want people to believe again i want everybody to not only believe in the promise of america but to work to achieve it and when i look at my new granddaughter obviously bill and i are gonna do whatever we can to make sure she had every opportunity in life but ill tell you thats not enough it matters what kind of country she becomes an adult in and what kind of world is out there waiting for her and i want to make sure that not just my granddaughter but all the children and young people in america have the same promise and potential that i believed was there waiting for me you shouldnt have to be the grand daughter of a former president should be able to fulfill your dreams that america i want that to be true for the granddaughter of factory workers in the grandsons of truck drivers and every single person and particularly every child in america in this campaign promise againthank you all so much i am absolutely delighted to be here some of you may know i had a pretty long day yesterday i finally got to answer questions something ive been pushing for literally a year and i am just grateful i recovered my voice which i lost a little bit but as i said at the start i wanted to rise above partisanship and reach for statesmanship and that is what i tried to do and now i am delighted to be here with all of you to be with the wlf a group that actually focuses on the issues you are women after my own heart and i want to thank debbie wasserman schultz carol penske cynthia friedman body shop and all the triptych speakers you heard from and well hear from including my friend leader nancy pelosi wanna say a word about another great democrat who has always been a champion for women and families and all of us vicepresident joe biden has been in the trenches for the violence against women act and so much more and im confident that history isnt finished with job i said the other day there is more work to do and if i know joe hell be right there with us on the front lines and i want to thank all of you for putting womens voices womens ideas womens lives right where they belong at the heart of american politics you know it is sometimes hard to believe but the notion that women should be equal partners in the life of our nation is still pretty new thats why the womens leadership forum was created to help make that ideal a reality during the campaign tipper gore and i traveled all over the country together and we spent a lot of time in peoples living rooms in their backyards sitting around kitchen tables talking with mothers and daughters and grandmothers about their lives and we heard so much we heard about the dreams for the future that people had for themselves and their kids and we heard a lot about the struggles that made life harder than it should be the problems that kept women up at night again and again we would hear you know no ones ever asked us these things before a lot of them it seemed like washington just wasnt very interested in the actual real lives of women in our country so we decided we had to make sure that in this party our party would always be heard that in this party our party the problems that keep women and their families up at night always be front and center and we wanted to bring more women into the electoral process as voters an advocate organizers fundraisers candidate and elected officials because we know women are half the country indeed likely more the planet and more than half the democratic party so we want to make sure that women and families are better represented in politics we need to get more of us involved in politics as we like to say when women lead families succeed and now twentytwo years later here in our country than ever before we are voting in greater numbers increasingly we are the decisive voters in national election more women are serving at high levels of government they are not one not two but three women on the supreme court the number of women who have served in the senate and the house of course another presidential election season has begun im doing everything i can to make sure that the issues that matter most to women and families are front and center in this race i started by campaign last spring doing the same thing that i did all those years ago when i ran the senate traveling across the country visiting peoples homes and schools and businesses and actually listening as they told me about their lives in the bad hard it was an amazing and humbling experience you find the time and space to give people a chance to talk to you talking about them in their hearts many families do feel for them credit as they should to president obama and his administration and i leadership and the hard work of the american people polled our economy and our nation back from the brink in fact we could have had a great depression great recession so as i travel across the country i try to tell the story of what president obama inherited the worst financial crisis since the great depression america is standing again were not running should be and families are still fresh in a million different directions and so are their budget rising but most peoples paychecks havent in years of corporate profits and ceo pay quality child care for college tuition in many states and the minimum wage is a power millions of americans are held back by student debt and at a time when more women than ever right there familys main breadwinners too often they still dont get equal pay and women of color earn less than others right and just this week the department of labor released new data showing that as our economy gets stronger mens page is going up more than twice as fast as womens pay one of my town halls and nevada called a little girl who was sitting with her father you never know what kids are gonna ask you which is why i try to call on at least one there in my town hall and she said if you are a girl president will you be paid as much as a boy think so but i think of the single mom i met whos juggling a job and classes at a community college while raising her three kids on her oh shes doing what she has to to give our children a better life and she doesnt expect anything to come easy but she asked me this is there anything we can do so it doesnt have to be quite so hard i think of the student who told me that paying for college shouldnt be the hardest thing about going to college where the man i met whose mother has alzheimers is a teacher can afford a fulltime caretaker for her cant quit his job he wouldnt be able to support her you know what he does she brings her to work with him theres nothing else you can think of to do and he told me this with so much sadness this is not what he picture his mothers golden years and its not just women taking care of aging parents it is like this young man yrs deserve a lot more and the same goes for other policies like paid family leave their and predictable ships higher wages so you dont have to work two jobs to make ends meet and you can actually be home with your kids at night and these are not just challenges for women their challenges for all americans because i firmly believe when we fight for women fighting for our entire country and the reverse is true as well when we fight to make america stronger and more prosperous we are also fighting we fight to make college more affordable and student debt less punishing or to hold corporations accountable when they gather just on drug prices prices are exploiting workers thats fighting for women and men and fighting for america and when we fight to create a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants or to make social security even stronger or to protect and improve the affordable care act because everyone deserves access to quality affordable care access should include basics like reproductive care including birth control cancer screening thats why we have to defend planned parenthood against attacks that are being way we fight to protect equal rights of all our people no matter what they look like and when we need to stop the epidemic of gun violence is claiming lives every day and every country thats fighting for women and men and fighting for america you know ive been told to stop shouting about gun though first of all im not joking just when women talk some people think i will not be silenced because we will not be silenced not by the gun lobby now by the size of this challenge by any of it stopping gun violence is worth fighting for and im ready to go and i are new to me and i know they arent new to many of you but we do have our work cut out for us because there are so many people with a very different visions for our country and they will say do and spend whatever it takes to advance theyre out of touch out of date agenda for people who say they hate big government republicans sure spend a lot of time trying to restrict womens reproductive health and reproductive rights my experience yesterday i just amazed that they are even talking about setting up another special investigative committee this time to investigate planned parenthood and i think we all know by now thats just code for a partisan witch hunt havent we seen enough of that id like those republican candidates who are advocating against planned parenthood to meet the mom who called her cancer early thanks to a screening at planned parenthood young woman who avoided an unintended pregnancy because she did have access to birth control now i know that when i talk like this republicans will say im playing the gender card you know what is what i say if calling for equal pay and paid leave and womens health is playing the gender card deal theres theres a long campaign still ahead of us and other candidates from the other party may be out there hurling insults at everyone and talking about whats wrong with america pointing fingers to try to blame people for it well thats not me im going to keep doing what i have always done and thats fight for you and fight for your families and i am so great hundreds of thousands of grassroots activists who are joining me in this campaign not only those fortunate enough like us to be in rooms like this one but the workers and students and teachers parents and grandparents all across our country were giving or at a time because they too believe in what we are fighting for so weve come a long way the past years im really proud of this organization and all that it has achieved the womens leadership forum has changed the democratic party changed it for the better or stronger than weve ever been so lets keep fighting for that better future for our children and our grandchildren now some of you im sure no i have the most amazing extraordinary granddaughter she really does keep me going and thankfully my daughter and wonderful son in laws send me a little videos pictures have been a great boost along the campaign trail i think a lot about her future i think about what kind of opportunity should have but i also think about what kind of opportunities all the children of america will have what kind of country will she become an adult in kind of world will be waiting for her because i dont think its not enough for anybody my granddaughter your children and grandchildren certainly the granddaughter by former president should be able to pursue her dreams so many of our other children in this country are feeling left behind and left out the first time in american history so far as i know more than half of the kids in our public schools are eligible for free or reduced price lunches poverty has returned with a vengeance made a lot of progress against poverty lifting families out of poverty back in the nineties i think its verifiable fact that our economy does better we have a democrat in the white house my husband and president obama inherited economic challenges from their republican predecessors worked hard with my husband was dealing with an economy that wasnt growing fast enough but then took off million new jobs and incomes rising at every part of our economy top middle and low income were doing better handed over a balanced budget into surplus to the incoming republican administration and they squandered it all cut taxes dramatically on the wealthy basically got out of the way of corporations to financial markets didnt pay a penny for the wars that they waged you know what happened and it took another democratic president here from later today comment the responsibility which he did try to repair the damage that had been done everything ive talked about before all of our rights hopes will be at risk the republicans once again are successful in making the same argument they always me discredited it doesnt work but that doesnt stop talking about cutting taxes on the wealthy to the way of corporations you know what that leads to increasing inequality of workers pollution of our environment of climate change refusal to move into the twenty first century clean renewable energy failure to provide early childhood education and universal prekindergarten so every kid has a chance to get ahead you can listen to their debates for hours and unfortunately some of us have to a single solution to any of the problems were facing here at home or around the world to my campaign is really an effort to try to build an america where everyone women and men can rise as far as their talent and hard work take them where everyone everyone has a shot and achieving their dreams and living up to their potential and yes my father and say to his daughter you can be anything you wanna be even president of the united states understanding is correct means no my way or the highway stuff it means we have to learn how to get along together and theyve given take with it what i was saying about them and i purposely said that because i knew you know what happened so we understand people in nazi germany did not believe and what hitler was doing but no they kept their mouths and when you do that you are compromising your freedom and the freedom of people who come behind you you have to be willing to stand up for what you believe the election in germany he won the election there were just so you know the white rose society there were a lot of folks now they might not have been enough to stand up for what they believe a surgeon im very impressed with that separated siamese twins scientists in yet i was reading that you dont believe in evolution again away before you go any further when i want to say is i wanted dont take this wrong missus cars and im not as a date but how do you feel about taking a trip to the museum of natural history with me we could do like a little walk through and have a discussion about i can have a very in depth discussion which had discussions with nobel laureates and they have to admit that you know the fact that they just dug up some years yeah first of all evolution micro evolution vs macro evolution are two different things for us right now we dont have the time of this conversation just going to talk about natural selection evolution and i believe yes organisms have an ability to adapt to their environment and they have the ability to change now the evolution is say that is proof positive of evolution myspace proof positive of an intelligent creator who gave his creatures the ability to adapt to their environment so that they dont have to start over and when can you believe involved and i have said people are allowed to some people believe that something came from nothing and then they believe that it exploded and we had a perfectly organized i dont believe that i dont denigrate people coming from out askew right after that tragic shooting in oregon last week you said gun control is not the answer and i know youre a big advocate for mental how but this morning you said that youd be very comfortable of kindergarten teachers had guns in the classroom when you think thats a good idea are trained and understand all the implications and you obviously im not just gonna have a weapon sitting on the kindergarten teachers desk and i know it would be secured in a place where kids could hike at an ar how fast can a teacher go to the lock draw and get their gun i was trained in diversionary tactics and whatever needs to be done in order to get there and i want to other people and thats cool also know that if you wanna go by what you would do with hurricane joaquin and you know you said you didnt know and actually look at your press secretaries face was priceless her but my favorite reaction but do you have an answer now question because i hope you saw that press conference we were talking about something completely different on the way out to the bus and someone brings up a new subject i said i dont know but she prepared for her son like we have some things and clearly we have a whole series of things and places for hurricanes and quite frankly if you if youre at the point where the president has to enact the things you have not done your homework that should be already in place and ready to go for him and i want to talk about your book my first clicking is one thing i do like about you is your tax idea what you pay the same tax flat tax and the ira hi cool beans for you but lets talk about your book the new perfect union trust placed well everybody knows that we have a constitution but not many people know and its very important because the founders of this nation said that our freedoms and our system is based upon a well informed and educated populace then it becomes very easy to fool people for instance you perfect example if youre not well educated come along and say you know what the economy is great unemployment is down the percent which is essentially full employment in great shape but if you are well educated and informed you know that you can make that number is based on who you are and that the labor force participation rate which is the number of people eligible to work or actually working thirty sevenyear low and we know we have problems and we need to fix them and these are not democrat or republican problems are problems that affect their house society and we have to stop making everything into a democrat or republican issue she said she did not want you to run for president until she became a grandmother you are now a grandmother of two why did you not want him to run for president you know weve been married forty years back to the the two granddaughters one of them was born on leap day so you know she didnt even have a birthday this should be a party to turn to next month when you look and you think about the debt that our country has weird and i have to leah which to pay it off if you were to pay off at a rate of million dollars every day days a year it would take you five thousand years thats how bad it with the first generation to make it worse for the next generation when i look at myself a superb you cant do that to them when i see other peoples babies dont see my own which is when i home but when i just makes me more determined that whatever i can do im gonna do well were gonna talk more when we come the secret to a happy home really one of the leaders in the polls and one of the other quotes that weve gotten from the research you sort of feel that theres not actually a war on women but there may be a war on whats inside of women is that the babies babies over the place and we should be understand my case i spent my entire career trying to preserve life and give people even operating on babies in the womb operating all night long sometimes on premature babies and i get to meet those people you know when theyre adults and productive adults there is no way you can convince me that theyre not important that theyre just the masses isles i just want to say i want to ask you this have you met with the women who have to make these horrendous decisions when they have to make them of whether or not they can bring a child into the world we talked about bringing children into the world all the time but periodically some women feel i just cant and are you sympathetic to them because we just said is that this is a job for us and the private sector what we need to do is make sure that we provide adequate day care so that they can get their ged there socially educated im talking about let me tell you for a fact is a lot of those young girls who are having babies out of wedlock when they have their first stop their education and that child is four times as likely to grow up in poverty we as a society have an obligation to do whats necessary to stop that cycle from his birth control then to the republican party they should be out there real real cloning planned parenthood for supplying birth control mammograms for the republican party sp you against birth control no im not ok so i guess you believe in daycare centers food stamps and all the things that because i get sick and tired of people particularly aggressive or he must have benefited from government programs and that he wants to withdraw all the programs that so many times you have a bunch of crap and what i really actually want to do is provide people with a mechanism for coming out of a state of dependency in climbing the ladder becoming part of the family but i think my question actually let everybody else asked their questions because the worst thing has happened in this nation since slavery in over million people have died because this country that is up for and by the people and government is supposed to be there to facilitate life with this particular active government comes along and says dont kill two people think this is what were doing the kremlin if you dont like the ships seems to be the way of the relationship between the people and the government the people are supposed to be at the pinnacle the government works for us is not the other way around ok thats very important we dont have one last thing you said that you dont necessarily relate to the republicans and i dont really say youre a democrat either so why do you wanna feel this way i dont speak for the very different things you dont like to well i am not a highly partisan person that issues that affect us financial collapse we dont change our ways republican or democrat issues that demand carson very good reaction to the ongoing few well number one i really respect the fact that jim is sticking up for his brother i mean i would stick up for my brothers also and he sticking up for his brother and i understand that but this all started when he said that were safe you know the country was safe well the world trade center was just attacked it fell down three thousand people were killed thousands and thousands of people were injured and to this day are injured and it was the worst attack in history so you cant say he kept our country safe because he was president you know its true image said the buck stops here so you as president and if you look at my book which was written a couple of years prior to the attack i actually mention the name of osama bin laden that hes a bad terrorist we have to do something about it and when one of your competitors heard about it today they said whoa whoa this is amazing comeback predicted it actually said in the book that something would happen nobody talks about it but i actually i have the quote let me put it up on the screen this is exactly what you wrote this was in a book you published in the america we deserve you said i am really convinced that were in danger of the sort of terrorist attacks that will make the bombing of the trade center look like kids play with firecrackers no sensible analysts rejects this possibility and plenty of them like me or not wondering if but when it will happen in the book you also wrote quote one day were told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named osama bin laden is public enemy number one and urs jet fighters lay waste to his camp in afghanistan he escapes back under some rocks and a few news cycle later its on to a new enemy a new crisis how could you have stopped it i mean i know whats happening sean i know whats going on i think i could have stopped it because i have very tough illegal immigration policies and people arent coming into this country unless they have that it invested properly if you look at what happened george tenet who is the head of the cia personable the cia the fbi and everybody else they werent talking with each other because they werent getting along thats leadership you have to get everybody to get along second of all george tenet predicted and attacked george tenet said theres going to be an attack they should have done something about it so im not blaming anybody in this started very innocently when i said you know to somebody frankly that didnt really matter i said listen the world trade center came down during you know theres nothing safe when the world trade center was attacked in came down during his reign well thats not safe because he said jeb said our country would say well thats not the case and then if you want to go a little further he then attacked the rack which turned out not to be the right country because they didnt have weapons of mass destruction and by the way the terrorists sent their familys home to saudi arabia they didnt send him home to iraq they sent him home to saudi arabia which is another thing for people to think about you know mr trump the only disagreement i have as we knew that saddam had weapons of mass destruction because we have the images of the kurds that was slaughtered and little children and women in the streets we knew there was a chemical attack and the world intelligence and fairness also thought that i want to add another element to this theres an unnoticed by the way but they didnt find myself well i dont know they never found him and frankly probably use them against iran which really was beautiful i mean that they use the weapons but the beauty of the woods yet these two countries that were equal in terms of strength and we decapitated one of those countries and now iran has taken over iraq and everything else and i should just take it lol and i ran is taking oil and theyre taking over the whole country so yeah its turned out to be really bad with that being said i respect the fact that jet is defending his brother i think thats good i would do the same thing but at one point ive always agree with you on is that if we liberate kuwait and we liberate iraq they need to pay us for the liberation we need to give money to the families that lost brave american soldiers or are injured now for the rest of their lives we dont do that and i also think that would help the ground isis never would have emerged he wanted to pull out for political reasons i love the you bring up kuwait kuwait had nothing but money they get attacked by iraq they take over kuwait the rich arabs go and they move into london as you know the kuwaiti they moved into london they didnt take a room like you would or maybe even i would they took the entire hotel and they live like kings and then we attack we lose lives we spent billions of dollars and we give it back two countries are not likely not that they dont even want to invest in and then i told him i had them in my office a few months after that they dont like investing in the united states ok we gave them the country back but nothing we shoulda said we want fifty percent of everything you make for the next years or permanently and you know what they would have agreed to it we gave it back for nothing why did we do that were stupid country thats the answer we negotiate better deals i agree with you let me play people want to add another element to this whole how come america wasnt prepared to drop in a littleknown speech on long island that bill clinton gave in february and to the audio audio is a little sketchy but i want to pay close attention where he said well he you know he we knew we wanted to commit crimes against america but i had no legal basis to take him and i think he missed the opportunity you would publish two years earlier what a bad guy bin laden was listen to clinton admit that he could have gotten him but he failed to take action was into this keywords are he committed no crimes against americans who i didnt bring him here because we had no basis on which to hold him even though we knew he wanted to commit crimes against america and heres the point in you identified him as a citizen a private citizen and bill clinton knew we wanted to commit crimes against america had the opportunity to get him and didnt take him doesnt he bear that responsibility well he made a mistake but i will tell you that if i were there i would have taken him out now i wrote about in my book and when they talk when i talk about the world trade center that was the first attack which was compared to what happened ultimately a minor but i talked about osama bin laden my book and people cant believe it they just starting to read that book was the only political book i had ever done and people just starting to read that book and they cant believe that i mention the name osama bin laden remember and treat you at a crawl under iraq but we have to get him at clinton made a mistake and frankly bushes have taken about somebody should have taken but i think i think my immigration policies would have gone a long way to helping us also show i think the immigration policy were now facing a crisis you see whats happening in europe theres a huge backlash because of syrian refugees and iraqi refugees and and the cost were being told by our national intelligence director that i sis n alqaida not if they will infiltrate the refugee camp community this president is committed to nearly coming to america that tells me where we have a pre my mindset again your thoughts i was always a big fan of merkels from germany im not offended him or what shes doing is insane and we want to take in two hundred thousand and we dont know where they come from they have no papers all we know is the young and theyre strong and mostly men and this could be the greatest trojan horse ever this could be bigger than the original progenitors we shouldnt be taken anybody we have enough problems we have to rebuild our country our infrastructure we all trillion dollars and by the way taken in two hundred thousand is going to cost the suggested a study over a period of years gonna cost us billions of dollars what are we doing merkel made a tremendous mistake they could end up having a revolution in germany you see whats happening with the german now what we should do at the same time from the humane sandpoint take a big chunk of syria and lets all put some money into it we have to kazan humane basis and build a safe zone whats called the safe zone let the people but to allow them into germany and to allow them into these other countries where theres nothing but haha rochelle you see whats happening and that were gonna take in two hundred thousand people in this country we dont know what were doing and i i suggested the same thing make it a secure zone offer humanitarian assistance often offer food water medicine supplies and keep them on in syria to close the circle on the feud with jet jet jet wins the nomination will you support absolutely yes i would absolutely supportive hes a good person hes a good man i would support him okay stay right there will have more coming up with donald trump the republicans poll which had you at of if you look at those at least i know you talked a lot about the polls but they have been steady they have been consistent and now byron york has a piece oh and theres another piece this week that says finally the establishment believes you can win and byron york outlines how the establishment prayer prepares to go after you is not being a conservative are you ready to deal with that and what will you do look i i have meetings in new hampshire we have thousands and thousands of people six seven eight thousand people every time i went to dallas we had twenty thousand and mark cubans arena was an amazing evening and alabama at oklahoma every place we go in iowa we have thousands and thousands overflow crowds people are tired of being ripped off in our country will run by people that are incompetent they dont know what theyre doing every nation is beating us obamacare is a disaster are a randall is horrible it was written by it was done by people that dont know what theyre doing i mean they dont know what theyre doing and people see whats happening and look they know i do things properly i do the right thing and they just like what im saying the establishment now thinks you can win and what theyre planning and what that telegraphing their planning is a barrages of ads in early states huge buys millions and millions of dollars trying to chip away at your conservative credentials with with primary voters what do you think is the best way to respond to that but theyre not buying the candidate john buying the edge the people that are buying the edge of the special interests the donors the people that a lobbyist you know you have lobbyists i dont have to lobbyists i used to contribute to the lobby who knows more about a lobbyist let me know the good ones and bad ones but the lobbyists are going crazy because when they come to me say they want me to do something for all these companies even though its not in the best interest of the united states im not gonna do it when the specialinterest tell me to do something that adverse to the people of the united states im not gonna do it because im not with you and your own money back fight back at the fight back but i wouldnt be leading every pop but john you have to understand these people have hundreds of millions of dollars that theyve given to these politicians and the politicians are puppets for them they just puppets with me im going to do whats right for the country we have trillion dollars in debt were gonna get the debt paid we gonna do things right were not gonna let china rip us off anymore its good its enough already you know that last year we had an imbalance with china of four hundred and fifty billion dollars who can who can stand that you cant do that and this has gone on for years and years and nobody does anything because they have lobbyists they have special interest and im gonna represent the people were gonna make this country so great and so strong but with that a lot of money is going to be spent and i just hope when people are watching this phonies edge you know all of these phony edged gonna be put out that they can understand its not the candidate its all of these specialinterest john that wanted not have a guy like trump because theyre gonna be out of business but then this is the art of political war for them and i think theyre serious about it because theyre talking about their power going away of the three democrats looks like bidens getting in the race so the three democrats biden hillary bernie sanders if you win the nomination is there anyone you prefer going up against well i dont think sanders is gonna get there frankly and i dont mind going against hillarys record i think id be there you saw the the various polls and myself against hillary i just beat her in florida po came out today where it beat her pretty easily in florida i beat her nationwide i dont mind going against her and you know biden is right now hes got his little period of time where hes popular soon as he gets in hell get beaten up badly hes done this three or four times hes lost every time so i dont mind going against him at all i dont i dont wanna pick a favorite to be honest i think i might have a favorite but if you go by hillarys record should win very easily have you given any thought if you win the nomination three people that you would consider to be your vice president i have given thought but i dont want to discuss it is just too early i have to get their first i dont like talking about it yet so many people they dont win they dont know how to win i dont want to talk about anything i do know how to win but thats so far down the road i will say i do respect some of the people that are running against and i respect many of the people you have many good republicans out there that could really help and be terrific and whether to unify the republican party were going to unify it and make it strong and were gonna win were not gonna do what romney did last time we shouldve won an election in the loss to unify the republican party and were gonna win i heard youre supposed to be on jimmy kimmel tonight did something happen now i have a political event but im gonna do his show in two weeks i have a big political event which i cant skip and i told him i said you know i have this event i cant skip it but i will be doing it in two weeks when im out in los angeles you know there was an article that came out about hillarys yes hes big hearings coming up about benghazi we know that ambassador stevens requested security before it was denied we know that during the attack that was a standdown order given because i interviewed people that were there they told me personally and we know they made up the story about a youtube video in a spontaneous demonstration we learned that about her what do you think about the hearings and there was another article that came out earlier today in washington free beacon the cheap aged men sixteen thousand dollars more a year than women whats your reaction of those two things with her well i have to tell you i was really looking forward to the hearings but then you add a congressman republican go against trey gowdy and all of the people as you know and then you had a whistleblower come out so that hurt that was not exactly positive and then yesterday i watched dr who i do respect i think hes a terrific guy but he seemed to be doing a big pivot he said well this isnt about hillary clinton im pretty good at figuring this stuff out and he seemed to be doing sean im surely im sure you saw it he seemed to be doing a big give it away from hillary clinton and i was trying to figure out what that was all about you may not be as happy as you think with these hearings i just dont know the hearings i was looking forward to him but with all thats happening and i was surprised that he pivoted away so much from miller he said these hearings are not about her actually we want to discuss other people much more so and it sounded like he was sort of pulling away from going after her so im gonna have to see what the hearings are all about the truck will resign as the election of my successor i will also resign as their representative from ohios eighth district at the end of this month i live with no regrets the burdens of anything i leave the way i started just a regular guy humbled by the chance to do a big drop thats what im most proud of im still just me the same guy who came here twenty years ago the small businessman and spent years trying to just be me but sometimes my staff thought i was too much like me but it really is a regular guy that came here to try to do a good job for my district my country before i go i express honors been to serve with all of you and the peoples house is in my view of the great and bottom embodiment of the american dream everybody here come from somewhere everybody here is uncertain mission you know i come from a part of the world where were used to working far back as i can remember i was working my dad was asked me the other day on the job when was the last time you didnt have a job i thought about why it would be eight or nine years old because that was thrown newspapers back then and working on my dad far better fact i used to work from am on saturday morning until pm for an hour i never thought about growing up is the easy way or the hard way of the cincinnati way and you know our city takes its name from a great roman general sense an abs a farmer who answered the call of his nation to lead and then surrendered his power to go back to his place for me it was an informant was a small business and it wasnt so much a calling as a commission to strive for a smaller less costly and more accountable federal government in washington how we do hear from facts for the first time in nearly twenty years weve made some real entitlement reforms a saving trillions of dollars over the long term reproductive the american people from an increase in our testers run track to save taxpayers trillion dollars over the next ten years the most significant spending reductions in modern times weve been to your marks altogether sorry rejected this institution weve made a more open to the people in every day and its capital city there are hundreds of kids from the toughest neighborhoods were finally getting the chance at a decent education things but the mission is not complete but the truth is it may never be one thing i came to realize over the two years and ive been here is that this battle over the size and scope and cost of government in washington has been going on for more than two hundred years and the forces of the status quo flood trouble to prevent change from happening real change takes time yes freedom makes all things possible but patience is what makes all things real believe in the law slow struggle believe in this countrys ability to meet our challenges in to lead the world and remember you cant do a big job alone especially this one so im grateful my family did in my dream girl of my dreams were office now theyre allowed over so theyve been through a lot you will know what your families go through its one thing for us to take the the brakes on the boards and everything gets thrown at us but its nothing for families they were thin skin as inspectors are grateful to all my colleagues my fellow leaders mccarthy mister schoolies has been more sliders and many on my side of the aisle our committee jurors people ive worked with them for a long time but im just grateful miss pelosi mister moyer clyburn others for the work that weve done together these last five years weve done an awful lot of work together probably more work done across the aisle over the last five years than in the years and ive served in this institution as much as i enjoy working with some of you learned address better ur you know who you are corporates the usual suspects that shows up here once in awhile that i but this morning he didnt but just very well but he did have a tone im grateful grateful to the people who work in this institution everyday and whether its the reading clerks here allow us to do our jobs and help make this institution what it is and whether its the people you see here today with the people and the ceos office with a capital police allege council there really are thousands of people really do allow us to do our job grateful to my staff now you all know im a big believer in none of us can be but we are without the good stuff i certainly would never have gotten to this job without having built a great team so i really am grateful to my staff as they like to say to each other once youre part of a girl and youre always part of the internal and that certainly goes for me as well especially grateful to all my constituents in the volunteers over the years that includes a student at miami university in oxford ohio in up campaign signs for me james paul ryan i dont anything you could pronounce my name back in was putting things up for me but a sense now is understood theres a difference between being asked to do something and being called to do something is being called i know grayson with energy and i would wish him and his family all the best described my life as the chase for the american dream at the bottom of the hill just off the main drag and really know how rates outside cincinnati job was a small house with a big grin as shining city on the hill had twists turns and even a few cheers of the role of that it was just perfect never forget where those people on the earth in america you can do anything that youre willing to work for willing to work hard out and things anything can happen if youre willing to make the necessary sacrifices in life if youre falter and you will you can just pick yourself up dust yourself off and go do it again because hope springs eternal and if you just do the right things for the right reasons good things will happen in this too could really happen to you god bless you and god blessthe some hot thank you very much president van zandt and thanks to everyone add to the new school for welcoming us today im delighted to be back you know over the past few months i a and have the opportunity to listen out to americans concerns about an economy thats still isnt delivering for them its not delivering the way that it should it still seems to most americans ive spoken with that it is stacked for those at the top but ive also heard about the hopes that people have for their future going to college without drowning in debt starting that small business theyve always dreamed about getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement previous generations of americans built the greatest economy and strongest middleclass the world has ever known on the promise have a basic bargain if you work hard and do your part you should be able to get ahead and when you get ahead america gets ahead but over the past several decades that bargain has eroded our job is to make it strong again for years republicans have argued that if we give morwell to those at the top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations right there own rules it will trickle down it will trickle down to everyone outs yet every time they have a chance to try that approach it explodes the national debt concentrates well even more and does practically nothing to help hardworking americans twice now in the past years a democrat president has had to calm in and clean up the mass left behind the i think the results speak for themselves under president clinton i like the sound of that america saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history nearly million jobs a balanced budget and a surplus for the future and most importantly incomes rose across the board not just for those already at the top eight years later president obama and the american peoples hard work hold us back from the brink a depression president obama saved the auto industry imposed new rules on wall street and provided health care to million americans now today today is the shadow of crisis recedes and longerterm challenges come into focus i believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy you cant have one without the other we cant create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth and we cant build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness we need both because while america is standing again we are not yet running the way we should corporate profits are at near record highs and americans are working as hard as ever but paychecks have barely budge in real terms families today are stretched in so many directions and so are their budgets outofpocket costs of health care childcare caring for aging parents are rising a lot faster than wages i hear this everywhere i go the single mom who talked to me about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids she doesnt expect anything to come easy but if she got a raise everything wouldnt be quite so hard the grandmother who works hound the clock providing child care to other peoples kids shes proud of her work but the pay is barely enough to live on especially with the soaring price up her prescription drugs the young entrepreneur whose dream buying the bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student dept if you can grow his business hell be able to pay of his dad and pay as employees including himself more too millions of hardworking americans tell similar stories reaches need to rise to keep up with costs paychecks need to grow families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead the defining economic challenge and our time is clear we must raise incomes for hardworking americans so they can afford a middleclass life we must drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country and that and that will be my mission from that first day im president to the last i am the i will get up every day thinking about the families have america like the family that i came from with a hardworking dad to start a small business since cramped and saved in gave us a good middleclass life ill be thinking about all the people that i represented here in new york in the stories that they told me and that i worked with them to improve and i will as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop have major changes in our economy and the global economy that didnt start with the recession and wont and with the recovery you know advances in technology and expanding global trade have created whole new areas of commercial activity and open new markets for exports but too often theyre also polarizing our economy benefiting highskilled workers but displacing board downgrading bluecollar jobs and other midlevel jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions americans todays marketplace focuses too much on the short term like second to second financial trading and quarterly earnings reports and too little on longterm investments meanwhile many americans are making extra money reading out a spare room designing web sites selling products they design themselves at home or even driving their own car this on demand or socalled gigot economy is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation but its also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future so i love these trends are real and none none is going away but they dont determine our destiny the choices we make as a nation matter and the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what american life in the middle class in our economy will be like in this century as president i will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents have changed start working for us more than against us to strengthen not howell out the american middle class because i think it our best thats what americans do we are problem solvers not did nine years we dont hide from change we harness said the measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families not just for successful ceos and money managers and not just some arbitrary growth target untethered to peoples lives and livelihood i wanna see our economy work for the struggling the striving and the successful were not gonna find all the answers we need today in the playbooks in the past we cant go back to the old policies that failed us before nor can we just replay the successes today is not its not so we need solutions for the big challenges we face now today im proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking americans an agenda for strong growth share growth and longterm growth let me begin with strong growth more growth means more jobs and more new businesses more jobs give people choices about where to work and employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones thats why economists how us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes small businesses create more than percent have new american jobs on net so they have to be a top priority ive said i want to be the small business president and i mean it and throughout this campaign im going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape easier access to capital tax relief and simplification how also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in america closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas and i know stop always how we think about this but another engine have strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform the the i want you to hear this bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy with increase our gross domestic product buying estimated billion dollars over years then there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs create the next generation of highpaying jobs you know when we get americans moving we get our country moving so lets establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private fun channel those funds to finance worldclass airports railways roads bridges and ports the and lets build those faster broadband networks and make sure theres a greater diversity a providers so consumers have more choice the and really theres no excuse not to make greater investment in cleaner renewable energy right now our economy obviously runs on energy and the time has calmed to make america the worlds clean energy superpower i advocate that because these investments will create millions jobs save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats up climate change and left fun the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the nineteen nineties and president obamas initiatives on pre cision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years i will set ambitious goals and all of these areas in the months ahead but today it let me emphasize another key ingredient have strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued breaking down barriers sell more americans participate more fully in the workforce a specially women the the we hour in a global competition as im sure you have noticed and we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines but thats exactly what were doing today when we leave people out or write them off we not only short change them and their dreams we shortchange our country and our future the movement love women into the american workforce over the past years was responsible for more than threeandahalf trillion dollars and economic growth but that progress has stalled the united states used to rank seventh outlive advanced countries in womens labor force participation by we had dropped to ninety that represents a lot ive on used potential for our economy and for american families studies show that nearly a third up this decline relative to other countries is because their expanding family friendly policies like paid leave and we are not we should be making it easier for americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying everyday about how theyre going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick you know last year last year while i was at the hospital here in manhattan waiting for little charlotte to make a grand entrance wanted the nurses said thank you for fighting for paid leave and we began to talk about it she sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps a cara its time to recognize that quality affordable child care is not a luxury its growth strategy and its way past time to and the outrage have so many women still earning less than man on the job and women up power making even less the you know all this lost money adds up and for some women its thousands have dollars every year now i am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as womens issues while those days are over fair pay and fair scheduling paid family leave and earned sick days childcare are sentul to our competitiveness and our growth and we can do this in a way that doesnt impose unfair burdens on businesses especially small businesses as president our fight to put families first just like i have my entire career now be on strong growth we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver have breezing incomes the evidence is in inequality is a drag on our entire economy so this is the problem we need to tackle now you may have heard governor bush say last week that americans just need to work longer hours well he must not have met very many american workers the let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the teacher who is in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night let him tell that to the fastfood workers marching in the streets for better pay they dont need a lecture they need a raise the the the truth theres the current rules for our economy to reward some work mike financial trading for example much more than other work like actually building and selling things the work that is always ban the backbone have our economy to get all incomes rising again we need to strike a better balance if you work hard you ought to be paid fairly so we do have to raise the minimum wage and implement president obamas new rules on overtime and then we have to go further out crackdown on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors or even steal their wages to make paycheck stretch we need to take on the major strains on family budgets out protect the affordable care act and build on it to lower outofpocket health care costs and to make prescription drugs more affordable will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing social security and making it easier to save for the future now many of these proposals are timetested and more been a little battlescarred we need new ideas as well and one that i believe in and will fight for is profitsharing hard working americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce so i will propose ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees thats good for workers and good for businesses study show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in a company success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees pockets its a winwin later this week in new hampshire ill have more to say about how we do this another priority must be reforming our tax code now we hear republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform but take a good look at their plans senator rubios would cut taxes for households making around three million dollars a year by almost two hundred and forty thousand dollars which is way more than three times the earnings abate typical family well thats a sure budgetbusting giveaway to the super wealthy and thats the kinda bad economics youre likely to hear from any at the candidates on the other side i have a different take guided by some simple principles first hardworking families need and deserve tax relief and simplification second those at the top have to pay their fair share thats why i support the buffett rule which make sure that millionaires dont pay lower rates than their secretaries ive also called for closing the carried interest loophole which lets wealthy financiers pay and artificially lull rate and lets agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything america has to offer should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share especially while companies who cant afford highprice lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more alongside tax reform its time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power which has been proven again and again to drive up wages republican governors like scott walker have made their names stomping on workers rights and practically all the republican candidates hope to do the same as president i will fight back against these meanspirited misguided attacks evidence the evidence shows that the decline unions may be responsible for a third have the increase have in a quality among men so if we want to get serious about raising incomes we have to get serious about supporting union workers the and let me just say a word here about trade the greek crisis as well as the chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth and ocean away are linked in a comment global economy trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades but he has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hardworking communities so we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements we should support them if they create jobs raise wages in advance our national security and we should be prepared to walk away if they dont to create share growth we need to create opportunity for more americans i love the saying by abraham lincoln who in many ways was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance up the middle class and the importance a government playing its role in providing opportunities he talked about giving americans a share chance in the race life i believe that with all my heart but i also believe it has to start really early at birth highquality early learning especially in the first five years conceptual drawing on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by percent and im committed to seeing every four year old in america have access to highquality preschool in the next years but i wanna do more i want to call for a crate outpouring have support from our faith community our business community are academic institutions from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens to really help parents particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles to really help prepare their own children in net age group eighty percent have your brain is physically formed by the age of three thats why families like mine read talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter ive said that her first words are gonna be enough with the reading and the copying singing but we do it not only because we love doing it even though ill admit its a little embarrassing you reading a book to a twoweek older a sixweekold can recall but we do it because we understand its building her capacity for learning and the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten she will have heard million more words than a child from unless advantaged background think ive what we are losing because were not doing everything we can to reach out to those families and we know again from so much research here in the united states and around the world at that early help that mentoring that intervention to help those often stressed out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid that difficulties that stand in the way and theyre being able to really get their child off to the best possible start we also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level in the coming weeks and months i will lay out specific steps to improve our schools make college truly affordable and help americans refinance their student debt and lets embrace lets embrace the idea lifelong learning in a jif technological change we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs there are exciting efforts underway and i wanna support and scale the ones that show results as we pursue all these policies we cant forget our fellow americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to call country indian country talent is universal you find it everywhere but opportunity is not there are nearly million young people age to in america today who are not in school or at work the numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering a quarter a young black man and nearly fifteen percent obama t know youth cannot find a job weve got to do a better way up coming up to match their growing middleclass incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class i firmly believe that the best antipoverty program is a job but thats hard to say if there arent enough jobs for people that were trying to help left themselves out of poverty thats why i had called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas when when all americans have the chance to study hard work hard and share in our countrys prosperity vats fair grow its what ive always believed in and its what i will fight for as president now the third key driver income alongside strong growth and share growth must be longterm growth too many pressures in our economy push us toward short term ism many business leaders see this theyve talked to me about it one is called it the problem up quarterly capitalism they say everythings focused and the next earnings report for the short term share price and the result is too little attention on the sources have longterm growth research and development physical capital and talent net business investment which includes things like factories machines and research labs had declined as a share the economy in recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends at doesnt leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a companys future success these trends need to change and i believe that many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities not just to todays share price but also to workers communities and ultimately to our country and indeed our planet now im not talking about charity im talking about clear id capitalism many companies have prospered by improving wages an training their workers that then yields higher productivity better service and larger profits now its easy to try to cut costs by holding down nor even decrease in pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but i would argue thats bad for business in the long run and its really bad for our country workers are assets investing in them pays off higher wages payoff training pays off to help more companies do that i proposed a new for fifteen hundred dollar tax credit for every worker they train and hire and i will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longerterm investments that create jobs more than just quick trades i will also propose reforms to help ceos and shareholders alike focus on the next decade rather than just the next day making sure stock buybacks arent being used only for an immediate boost in share prices empowering outside investors who want to build companies but discouraging cut and ron shareholders who act more like all school corporate raiders and nowhere will be shipped from shortterm to longterm be more important that on wall street as a former senator from new york i know firsthand the role that wall street can and should play in our economy helping main street grow and prosper and boosting new companies that make america more competitive globally but as we all know in the years before the crash financial firms piled risk up on risk and regulators in washington either couldnt or wouldnt keep up i was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks derivatives cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight under president obamas leadership weve imposed tough new rules that deal with some other challenges on wall street but those rules have been under assault by republicans in congress and those running for president i will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms weve made we can do that and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust we also have to go beyond doddfrank too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky and the problems are not limited to the big banks to get all the headlines serious risks are emerging from institutions and socalled shadow banking system including hedge funds highfrequency traders nonbank finance companies so many new kinds up entities which receive little oversight at all stories have misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking hsbc allowing drug cartels to launder money five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates there can be no justification or tolerance for this kind a criminal behavior and while institutions had paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all even when theyve already pocketed the gains this is wrong and on my watch it will change over the course over the course of this campaign i will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on wall street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors not just highfrequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections i will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem will ensure will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee and we will prosecute individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing and when the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public it could for example help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers now reform is never easy but weve done it be four in our country and we have to get it right this time and yes we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us two years ago the head of the chicago mercantile exchange terry duffy published an oped in the wall street journal that really caught my attention he wrote and i quote im concerned that does a bus in financial services have forgotton who we serve and that the public knows it some wall streeters can to easily slip into regarding their work as a kinda moneymaking game divorced from the concerns ive main street and prompt i think we should listen to terry duffy of course longterm growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well so its time to and the era a budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one self inflicted crisis to another its time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how were going to tackle the big stuff together how do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs then it displaces or destroys can we sustain a boon in advanced manufacturing what are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors like silicon valley questions like these demands thoughtful and mature debate from our policymakers in government from our leaders in the private sector our economists are academics others who can come together to the table and on behalf america perform their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and are middleclass keeps growing the so government has to be smarter simpler more focused itself on longterm investments than short term politics and be a better partner to cities states and the private sector washington has to be a better stewart americans tax dollars and americans trust and please lets get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology the thats what ill do as president i will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality i wanna have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together and i will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable including by continuing to restrain health care costs which remain one of the key drivers have longterm deficits i will make sure washington learns from how well local governments businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across america no passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress as president i will use the power to convene connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done because above all we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the longterm needs our country i i confess maybe its the grandmother in may but i believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade youll never see it and a vision ive laid out here today for strong growth share growth and longterm growth all working together will get incomes rising again will help working families get ahead and stay ahead that is the test have our time and im inviting everyone to please join me to do your part thats what great countries do thats what our country always has done we rise to challenges its not about left right or center its about the future versus the past im running for president to build an america for tomorrow not yesterday an america built on growth and fairness an america where if you do your part you will reap the rewards where we dont leave any why the the the the thank you all the i just want to leave you with one more thought i want every child not just the grand daughter of a former president or former secretary of state but every child or her godgiven potential please join me in that mission lets do it together thank you uh the driving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas when when all americans have the chance to study hard work hard and share in our countrys prosperity vats fair grow

when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing and when the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public the some hot thank you very much president van zandt and thanks to everyone add to the new school for welcoming us today im delighted to be back you know over the past few months i am have the opportunity to listen out to americans concerns about an economy thats still isnt delivering for them its not delivering the way that it should it still seems to most americans ive spoken with that it is stacked for those at the top but ive also heard about the hopes that people have for their future going to college without drowning in debt starting that small business theyve always dreamed about getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement previous generations of americans built the greatest economy and strongest middleclass the world has ever known on the promise have a basic bargain if you work hard and do your part you should be able to get ahead and when you get ahead america gets ahead but over the past several decades that bargain has eroded our job is to make it strong again for years republicans have argued that if we give morwell to those at the top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations right there own rules it will trickle down it will trickle down to everyone else yet every time they have a chance to try that approach it explodes the national debt concentrates well even more and does practically nothing to help hardworking americans twice now in the past years a democratic president has had to calm in and clean up the mass left behind the i think the results speak for themselves under president clinton i like the sound of that america saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history nearly million jobs a balanced budget and a surplus for the future and most importantly incomes rose across the board not just for those already at the top eight years later president obama and the american peoples hard work hold us back from the brink have depression president obama saved the auto industry imposed new rules on wall street and provided health care to million americans now today today as the shadow of crisis recedes and longerterm challenges come into focus i believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy you cant have one without the other we cant create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth and we cant build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness we need both because while america is standing again we are not yet running the way we should corporate profits are at near record highs and americans are working as hard as ever but paychecks have barely budged in real terms families today are stretched in so many directions and so are their budgets outofpocket costs of health care childcare caring for aging parents are rising a lot faster than wages i hear this everywhere i go the single mom who talked to me about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids she doesnt expect anything to come easy but if she got a raise everything wouldnt be quite so hard the grandmother who works hound the clock providing child care to other peoples kids shes proud ever work but the pay is barely enough to live on especially with the soaring price up her prescription drugs the young entrepreneur whose dream buying the bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student dept if he can grow his business hell be able to pay of his dad and pay as employees including himself more too millions of hardworking americans tell similar stories reaches need to rise to keep up with costs paychecks need to grow families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead the defining economic challenge and our time is clear we must raise incomes for hardworking americans so they can afford a middleclass life we must drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country and that and that will be my mission from that first day im president to the last i am the i will get up every day thinking about the families have america like the family that i came from with a hardworking dad to start a small business since cramped and saved in gave us a good middleclass life ill be thinking about all the people that i represented here in new york in the stories that they told me and that i worked with them to improve and i will as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop have major changes in our economy and the global economy that didnt start with the recession and wont and with the recovery you know advances in technology and expanding global trade have created whole new areas of commercial activity and open new markets for exports but too often theyre also polarizing our economy benefiting highskilled workers but displacing word downgrading bluecollar jobs into the american workforce over the past years was responsible for more than threeandahalf trillion dollars and economic growth but that progress has stalled the united states used to rank seventh outlive advanced countries in womens labor force participation by we had dropped to ninety that represents a lot ive on used potential for our economy and for american families studies show that nearly a third up this decline relative to other countries is because their expanding family friendly policies like paid leave and we are not we should be making it easier for americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying everyday about how theyre going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick you know last year last year while i was at the hospital here in manhattan waiting for little charlotte to make a grand entrance wanted the nurses said thank you for fighting for paid leave and we began to talk about it she sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of its time to recognize that quality affordable child care is not a luxury its growth strategy and its way past time to and the outrage have so many women still earning less than man on the job and women up power making even less the you know all this lost money adds up and for some women its thousands have dollars every year now i am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as womens issues while those days are over the fair pay and fair scheduling paid family leave and earned sick days childcare are sentul to our competitiveness and our growth and we can do this in a way that doesnt impose unfair burdens on businesses especially small businesses as president our fight to put families first just like i have my entire career now be on strong growth we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver have breezing incomes the evidence is in inequality is a drag on our entire economy so this is the problem we need to tackle now you may have heard governor bush say last week that americans just need to work longer hours well he must not have met very many american workers the let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the teacher who is in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night let him tell that to the fastfood workers marching in the streets for better pay they dont need a lecture they need a raise the the the truth says the current rules for our economy to reward some work mike financial trading for example much more than other word like actually building and selling things the work that is always ban the backbone have our economy to get all incomes rising again we need to strike a better balance if you work hard you ought to be paid fairly so we do have to raise the minimum wage and implement president obamas new rules on overtime and then we have to go further out crackdown on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors or even steal their wages to make paycheck stretch we need to take on the major strange on family budgets out protect the affordable care act and build on it to lower outofpocket health care costs and to make prescription drugs more affordable will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing social security and making it easier to save for the future now many of these proposals are timetested and more been a little battlescarred we need new ideas as well and one that i believe in and will fight for is profitsharing hard working americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce so i will propose ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees thats good for workers and good for businesses study show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in a company success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees pockets its a winwin later this week in new hampshire ill have more to say about how we do this another priority must be reforming our tax code now we hear republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform but take a good look at their plans senator rubios would cut taxes for households making around three million dollars a year by almost two hundred and forty thousand dollars which is way more than three times the earnings have a typical family well thats a sure budgetbusting giveaway to the super wealthy and thats the kinda bad economics youre likely to hear from any at the candidates on the other side i have a different take guided by some simple principles first hardworking family and other midlevel jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions americans todays marketplace focuses too much on the short term like second to second financial trading and quarterly earnings reports and too little on longterm investments meanwhile many americans are making extra money reading out a spare room designing web sites selling products they design themselves at home or even driving their own car this on demand or socalled gigot economy is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation but its also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future so i love these trends are real and none none is going away but they dont determine our destiny the choices remake as a nation matter and the choices we made in the years ahead will set the stage for what american life in the middle class in our economy will be like in this century as president i will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents have changed start working for us more than against us to strengthen not howell out the american middle class because i think it our best thats what americans do we are problem solvers not did nine years we dont hide from change we harness said the measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families not just for successful ceos and money managers and not just some arbitrary growth target untethered to peoples lives and livelihood i wanna see our economy work for the struggling the striving and the successful were not gonna find all the answers we need today in the playbooks in the past we cant go back to the old policies that failed us before nor can we just replay the successes today is not its not so we need solutions for the big challenges we face now today im proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking americans an agenda for strong growth share growth and longterm growth let me begin with strong growth more growth means more jobs and more new businesses more jobs give people choices about where to work and employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones thats why economists how us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes small businesses create more than percent have new american jobs on net so they have to be a top priority ive said i want to be the small business president and i mean it and throughout this campaign im going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape easier access to capital tax relief and simplification how also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in america closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas and i know its top always how we think about this but another engine out strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform the the i want you to hear this bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy with increase our gross domestic product buying estimated billion dollars over years then there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs create the next generation of highpaying jobs you know when we get americans moving we get our country moving so lets establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private fun channel those funds to finance worldclass airports railways roads bridges and ports the and lets build those faster broadband networks and make sure theres a greater diversity a providers so consumers have more choice the and really theres no excuse not to make greater investment in cleaner renewable energy right now our economy obviously runs on energy and the time has calmed to make america the worlds clean energy superpower i advocate that because these investments will create millions jobs save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats up climate change and lets fun the scientific and medical research thats ponds innovative companies and creates entire new industries just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the nineteen nineties and president obamas initiatives on pre cision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years i will set ambitious goals and all of these areas in the months ahead but today let me emphasize another key ingredient have strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued breaking down barriers sell more americans participate more fully in the workforce a specially women the we hour in a global competition as im sure you have noticed add we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines but thats exactly what were doing today when we leave people out or write them off we not only short change them and their dreams we shortchange our country and our future the movement love women days need and deserve tax relief and simplification second those at the top have to pay their fair share thats why i support the buffett rule which make sure that millionaires dont pay lower rates than their secretaries ive also called for closing the carried interest loophole which lets wealthy financiers pay and artificially lull rate and lets agree thats hugely successful companies that benefit from everything america has to offer should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share especially while companies who cant afford highpriced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more alongside tax reform its time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power which has been proven again and again to drive up wages republican governors like scott walker have made their names stomping on workers rights and practically all the republican candidates help to do the same as president i will fight back against these meanspirited misguided attacks evidence the evidence shows that the decline unions may be responsible for a third have the increase have in a quality among men so if we want to get serious about raising incomes we have to get serious about supporting union workers the and let me just say a word here about trade the greek crisis as well as the chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth and ocean away are linked in a comment global economy trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades but he has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hardworking communities so we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements we should support them if they create jobs raise wages in advance our national security and we should be prepared to walk away if they dont to create share growth we need to create opportunity for more americans i love the saying by abraham lincoln who in many ways was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance up the middle class and the importance a government playing its role in providing opportunities he talked about giving americans a share chance in the race life i believe that with all my heart but i also believe it has to start really early at birth highquality early learning especially in the first five years can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by percent and im committed to seeing every four year old in america have access to highquality preschool in the next years but i wanna do more i want to call for a crate outpouring have support from our faith community our business community are academic institutions from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens to really help parents particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles to really help prepare their own children in net age group eighty percent have your brain is physically formed by the age of three thats why families like mine read talkin saying endlessly to our granddaughter ive said that her first words are gonna be enough with the reading and the cocking singing but we do it not only because we love doing it even though ill admit its a little embarrassing youre reading a book to a twoweek older a sixweekold can recall but we do it because we understand its building her capacity for learning and the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten she will have heard million more words than a child from unless advantaged background think ive what we are losing because were not doing everything we can to reach out to those families and we know again from so much research here in the united states and around the world at that early help that mentoring that intervention to help those often stressed out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid that difficulties that stand in the way and theyre being able to really get their child off to the best possible start we also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level in the coming weeks and months i will lay out specific steps to improve our schools make college truly affordable and help americans refinance their student debt and lets embrace lets embrace the idea lifelong learning in a jif technological change we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs there are exciting efforts underway and i wanna support and scale the ones that show results as we pursue all these policies we cant forget our fellow americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to call country indian country talent is universal you find it everywhere but opportunity is not there are nearly million young people age to in america today who are not in school or at work the numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering a quarter a young black man and nearly fifteen percent of all latino youth cannot find a job weve got to do a better way up coming up to match their growing middleclass incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class i firmly believe that the best antipoverty program is a job but thats hard to say if there arent enough jobs for people that were trying to help left themselves out of poverty thats why i had called for reviewseven years after the financial crash despite important new rules signed into law by president barack obama there are risks in our financial system that could still cause another crisis banks have paid billions of dollars in fines but few executives have been held personally accountable “too big to fail” is still too big a problem regulators don’t have all the tools and support they need to protect our economy to prevent irresponsible behavior on wall street from ever again devastating main street we need more accountability tougher rules and stronger enforcement i have a plan to build on the progress we’ve made under president obama and do just that in the years before the crash as financial firms piled risk upon risk regulators in washington either couldn’t or wouldn’t keep up top regulators under president george w bush posed for a picture literally taking a chain saw to banking rules before the crisis hit as a senator from new york i was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives cracking down on abusive subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight unfortunately the bush administration and republicans in congress largely ignored calls for reform the result cost million americans their jobs drove million families out of their homes and wiped out more than trillion in household wealth thanks to president obama’s leadership and the determination and sacrifice of the american people we’ve worked our way out of that ditch and put our economy on sounder footing now we have to keep going first it’s time for more accountability on wall street stories of misconduct in the financial industry are shocking like hsbc allowing drug cartels to launder money or five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange rates this is criminal behavior yet the individuals responsible often get off with limited consequences or none at all i want to change that people who commit serious financial crimes should face serious consequences including big fines disbarment from working in the industry and the prospect of imprisonment as president i will seek to extend the statute of limitations for major financial crimes enhance whistleblower rewards and increase resources for the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission to investigate and prosecute individuals we should also hold financial executives accountable for egregious misconduct by their subordinates they need to lose their bonuses and in some cases their jobs second i will work with congress and independent regulators to rein in the complexity and riskiness of major financial institutions the doddfrank act that president obama signed after the crisis has already made important reforms but there’s more to do one serious approach being advocated is to pass an updated glasssteagall act separating commercial and investment banking to reduce the size of the banks and the risk of a taxpayer bailout i certainly share the goal of never having to bail out the big banks again but i prefer the path of tackling the most dangerous risks in a different way to start i will propose a new fee on risk that would discourage the type of excessive leverage and shortterm borrowing that could spark another crisis we should also strengthen and enforce the volcker rule so banks can’t make risky and speculative trading bets with taxpayerbacked money and if a bank suffers losses that threaten its overall financial health senior managers should lose some or all of their bonus compensation that will ensure that financial executives have skin in the game and a real incentive to avoid reckless risktaking my plan would also give regulators the authority they need to reorganize downsize or even break apart any financial institution that is too large and risky to be managed effectively it is a comprehensive and flexible approach it allows regulators to adapt to changing markets and help ensure that large financial firms never pose a danger to our entire economy we’ve learned the hard way that there’s no substitute for tough empowered regulators with the resources and support to do their job that’s why i’ve supported wisconsin senator tammy baldwin’s bill to restore trust in government and slow wall street’s revolving door we need to find the best most independentminded people for these important regulatory jobs people who will put consumers and everyday investors ahead of the industries and institutions they’re supposed to oversee third we need a comprehensive strategy to reduce risk everywhere in the financial system after all many of the firms at the heart of the crash in like lehman brothers bear stearns and aig were not traditional banks i’ll push for stronger oversight of the “shadow banking” sector which includes certain activities of hedge funds investment banks and other nonbank finance companies fourth we need to ensure that everyday investors and consumers can trust that our financial markets work for them and not just for insiders with the most sophisticated specialized and fastest connections that is why we should impose a tax on the highfrequency trading that makes our markets less stable and less fair and we should reform the rules that govern our stock markets to ensure equal access to markets and information increase transparency and minimize conflicts of interest finally i will veto any legislation that would weaken doddfrank we can’t go back to the days when wall street could write its own rules i believe we can defend doddfrank while easing burdens on community banks so they are able to lend responsibly to the hardworking families and small businesses they know and trust we also have to defeat republican attempts to gut the consumer financial protection bureau an agency dedicated solely to protecting americans from unfair and deceptive financial practices and to exploit the upcoming budget and debtceiling negotiations for rollbacks in financial reforms the bottom line is that we can never allow what happened in to happen again just as important we have to encourage wall street to live up to its proper role in our economy helping main street grow and prosper with strong rules of the road and smart incentives the financial industry can help more young families buy that first home make it possible for entrepreneurs to create new small businesses and support hardworking americans saving for retirement my plan will help us unlock that potential we’ll create goodpaying jobs raise incomes and help families afford a middleclass life with less speculation and more growth growth that’s strong fair and longterm that’s what i’m fighting for in my campaign and that’s what i’ll do as presidentthank you thank you so much thank you very much president van zant and thanks to everyone at the new school for welcoming us today i’m delighted to be back you know over the past few months i have had the opportunity to listen to americans’ concerns about an economy that still isn’t delivering for them it’s not delivering the way that it should it still seems to most americans that i have spoken with that it is stacked for those at the top but i’ve also heard about the hopes that people have for their future — going to college without drowning in debt starting that small business they’ve always dreamed about getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement previous generations of americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain if you work hard and do your part you should be able to get ahead and when you get ahead america gets ahead but over the past several decades that bargain has eroded our job is to make it strong again for years republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules it will trickle down it will trickle down to everyone else yet every time they have a chance to try that approach it explodes the national debt concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hardworking americans twice now in the past years a democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind i think the results speak for themselves under president clinton — i like the sound of that — america saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history nearly million jobs a balanced budget and a surplus for the future and most importantly incomes rose across the board not just for those already at the top eight years later president obama and the american people’s hard work pulled us back from the brink of depression president obama saved the auto industry imposed new rules on wall street and provided health care to million americans now today — today as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer term challenges come into focus i believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy you can’t have one without the other we can’t create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth and we can’t build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness we need both because while america standing again we are not yet running the way we should corporate profits are at near record highs and americans are working as hard as ever but paychecks had nearly budged in real terms families today are stretched in so many directions and so are their budgets out of pocket costs of health care child care hearing for aging parents are rising a lot faster than wages i hear this everywhere i go a single mom talked about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids she doesn’t expect anything to come easy but if she got a raise everything would not be quite so hard the grandmother who works around the clock providing child care to other people’s kids she’s proud of her work but the pay is fairly enough to live on especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs the young entrepreneur whose dream of buying a bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt if he can grow his business he can pay off his debt and pay his employees including himself more too millions of hardworking americans tell similar stories wages need to rise to keep up with cost paychecks need to grow families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead the defining economic challenge of our time clear we must raise incomes for hardworking americans so they can afford a middleclass life we must drive steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country and that… and that will be my mission from the first day i am president to the last i… i will get up every day thinking about the families of america like the family i came from with a hardworking dad who started a small business and scrimped and saved and gave us a good middle class life i will be thinking about all the people that i represented in new york and the stories that they told me and that i worked with them to improve i will as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that did not start with the recession and will not end with the recovery you know advances in technology and expanding global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports too often they are polarizing our economy benefiting high skilled workers but displacing and downgrading bluecollar jobs and other midlevel jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions of americans today’s marketplace focuses too much on the shortterm like second to second financial trading and quarterly earnings reports and too little on longterm investments meanwhile many americans are making extra money renting out a small room designing websites selling products they design themselves at home or even driving their own car this ondemand or socalled gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation but it is also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future so all of these trends are real and none none is going away but they do not determine our destiny the choices we make as a nation matter and the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what american life in the middle class and our economy will be like in this century as president i will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us to strengthen not hollow out the american middle class because i think at our best that’s what americans do we are problem solvers not deniers we don’t hide from change we harness it the measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families not just for successful ceos and money managers and not some just arbitrary growth targets untethered to people’s lives and livelihoods i want to see our economy work for the struggling the striving and the successful we’re not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past we can’t go back to the old policies that failed us before nor can we just replay the successes today is not it’s not so we need solutions for the big challenges we face now so today i’m proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking americans an agenda for strong growth fair growth and longterm growth let me begin with strong growth more growth means more jobs and more new businesses more jobs give people choices about where to work and employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones that’s why economists tell us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes small businesses create more than percent of new american jobs on net so they have to be a top priority i’ve said i want to be the smallbusiness president and i mean it and throughout this campaign i’m going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape easier access to capital tax relief and simplification i’ll also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in america closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas and i know it’s not always how we think about this but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform i want you to hear this bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated billion over years then there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs create the next generation of highpaying jobs you know when we get americans moving we get our country moving so let’s establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private funds… … channel those funds to finance worldclass airports railways roads bridges and ports and let’s built those faster broadband networks and make sure there’s a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice and really there’s no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now our economy obviously runs on energy and the time has come to make america the cleanenergy superpower i advocate that because these investments will create millions of jobs save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change and let’s fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the s and president obama’s initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years i will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead but today let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued breaking down barriers so more americans participate more fully in the workforce especially women we are in a global competition as i’m sure you have noticed and we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines but that’s exactly what we’re doing today when we leave people out or write them off we not only shortchange them and their dreams we shortchange our country and our future the movement of women into the american workforce over the past years was responsible for more than trillion in economic growth but that progress has stalled the united states used to rank th out of advanced countries in women’s labor force participation by we had dropped to th that represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for american families studies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they’re expanding familyfriendly policies like paid leave and we are not we should be making it easier for americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they’re going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick you know last year – – last year while i was at the hospital here in manhattan waiting for little charlotte to make her grand entrance one of the nurses said thank you for fighting for paid leave and we began to talk about it she sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of it’s time to recognize that quality affordable childcare is not a luxury it’s a growth strategy and it’s way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job and women of color making even less you know all this lost money adds up and for some women it’s thousands of dollars every year now i am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women’s issues well those days are over fair pay and fair scheduling paid family leave and earned sick days childcare are essential to our competitiveness and our growth and we can do this in a way that doesn’t impose unfair burdens on businesses especially small businesses as president i’ll fight to put families first just like i have my entire career now beyond strong growth we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of raising incomes the evidence is in inequality is a drag on our entire economy so this is the problem we need to tackle now you may have heard governor bush say americans just need to work longer hours well he must not have met very many american workers let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the teacher who in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night let him tell that to the fast worker marching in the streets for better pay they do not need a lecture they need a raise the truth is the current rules for our economy do reward some work like financial trading for example much more than other work like actually building and selling things the work that has always been the backbone of our economy to get all incomes rising again we need to strike a better balance if you work hard you ought to be a fairly so we do have to raise the minimum wage and implement president obama’s new rules on overtime and then we have to go further i will crack down on bosses who exploit employees by mis classifying them as contractors or even steal their wages to make paychecks stretch we need to take on the major strains on family budgets i will protect the affordable care act and build on it to lower outofpocket health care costs and to make prescription drugs more affordable we will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing social security and making it easier to save for the future now many of these proposals are timetested and more than a little battle scarred we need new ideas as well and one i believe in and will fight for is profitsharing hardworking americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce so i will produce ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees that is good for workers and good businesses studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in the company’s success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees’ pockets it’s a winwin later this week in new hampshire i will have more to say about how we do this another priority must be reforming our tax code now we hear republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform but take a good look at their plans senator rubio’s would cut taxes for households making around million a year by almost which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family well that is a sure budget busting giveaway to the super wealthy and that’s the kind of bad economics you are likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side i have a different take… … guided license principles first hardworking families need and deserve tax relief and simplification second those at the top have to pay their fair share that’s why i support the buffet rule which makes sure millionaires do not pay lower rates than their secretaries i have called for closing the carried interest loophole that lets wealthy financiers pay an artificially low rate and let’s agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything that america has to offer should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share especially while companies who can’t afford highpriced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more alongside tax reform it’s time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power which has been proven again and again to drive up wages republican governors like scott walker have made their names stomping on workers’ rights and practically all the republican candidates hope to do the same as president i will fight back against these meanspirited misguided attacks evidence – – evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase of inequality among men so if we want to get serious about raising incomes we have to get serious about supporting union workers and let me just say a word here about trade the greek crisis as well as the chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades but it has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hardworking communities so we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements we should support them if they create jobs raise wages and advance our national security and we should be prepared to walk away if they don’t to create fair growth we need to create opportunity for more americans i love the saying by abraham lincoln who in many ways was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of government playing its role in providing opportunities he talked about giving americans a fair chance in the race of life i believe that with all my heart but i also believe it has to start really early at birth high quality early learning especially in the first five years can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by percent and – – and i’m committed to seeing every yearold in america have access to high quality preschool in the next years but i want to do more i want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community our business community our academic institutions from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens to really help parents particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles to really help prepare their own children in that to age group eighty percent of your brain is physically formed by the age of that’s why families like mine read talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter i’ve said that her first words are going to be enough with the reading and the talking and the singing laughter but we do it not only because we love doing it even though i’ll admit it’s embarrassing you know reading a book to a twoweekold or a sixweekold or a weekold but we do it because we understand it’s building her capacity for learning and the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten she will have heard million more words than a child from a less advantaged background think of what we are losing because we’re not doing everything we can to reach out to those families and we know again from so much research here in the united states and around the world that that early help that mentoring that intervention to help those often stressedout young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to really get their child off to the best possible start we also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level and in the coming weeks and months i will lay out specific steps to improve our schools make college truly affordable and help americans refinance their student debt and let’s embrace – – let’s embrace the idea of lifelong learning in an age of technological change we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs there are exciting efforts underway and i want to support and scale the ones that show results as we pursue all these policies we cant forget our fellow americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to coal country to indian country talent is universal you find it everywhere but opportunity is not there are nearly million young people aged to in america today who are not in school or at work the numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering a quarter of young black men and nearly percent of all latino youth cannot find a job we’ve got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class i firmly believe that the best antipoverty program is a job but that’s hard to say if there aren’t enough jobs for people that were trying to help lift themselves out of poverty that’s why ive called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas when – – when all americans have the chance to study hard work hard and share in our country’s prosperity that’s fair growth it’s what i’ve always believed in and it’s what i will fight for as president now the third key driver of income alongside strong growth and fair growth must be longterm growth too many pressures in our economy push us toward shorttermism many business leaders see this they’ve talked to me about it one has called it the problem of quarterly capitalism they say everything is focused on the next earnings report or the shortterm share price and the result is too little attention on the sources of longterm growth research and development physical capital and talent net business investment which includes things like factories machines and research labs have declined as a share of the economy in recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends that doesn’t leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a company’s future success these trends need to change and i believe many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities not just to today’s share price but also to workers communities and ultimately to our country and indeed our planet now i’m not talking about charity i’m talking about cleareyed capitalism many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yield higher productivity better service and larger profits now it’s easy to try to cut costs by holding down or even decreasing pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but i would argue that’s bad for business in the long run and it’s really bad for our country workers are assets investing in them pays off higher wages pay off training pays off to help more companies do that i proposed a tax credit for every worker they train and hire and i will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longerterm investments that create jobs more than just quick trades i will also propose reforms to help ceos and shareholders alike to focus on the next decade rather than just the next day making sure stock buybacks aren’t being used only for an immediate boost in share prices empowering outside investors who want to build companies but discouraging cut and run shareholders who act more like oldschool corporate raiders and nowhere will the shift from shortterm to longterm be more important than on wall street as a former senator from new york i know firsthand the role that wall street can and should play in our economy helping main street grow and prosper and boosting new companies that make america more competitive globally but as we all know in the years before the crash financial firms piled risk upon risk and regulators in washington either could not or would not keep up i was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight under president obama’s leadership we have imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on wall street those rules have been under assault by republicans in congress and those running for president i will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms we have made we can do that and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust we also have to go beyond doddfrank too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky and the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines serious risks are emerging from institutions in the socalled shadow banking system including hedge funds highfrequency traders non bank finance companies so many new kinds of entities which receive little oversight at all stories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking hsbc allowing drug cartels to launder money five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates there can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior and while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all even when they have already pocketed the gains this is wrong and on my watch it will change over the course… … over the course of this campaign i will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on wall street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors not just highfrequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections i will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem we will ensure… we will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee and we will also process individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing when the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public it could for example help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers now reform is never easy but we’ve done it before in our country and we have to get it right this time and yes we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us two years ago the head of the chicago mercantile exchange terry duffy published an oped in the wall street journal that really caught my attention he wrote and i quote “i’m concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who they serve and that the public knows it some wall streeters can too easily slip into regarding their work as a kind of moneymaking game divorced from concerns of the main street” unquote i think we should listen to terry duffy of course longterm growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well so it’s time to end the era of budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one selfinflicted crisis to another it’s time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how we’re going to tackle the big stuff together how do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing what are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors like silicon valley questions like these demand thoughtful and mature debate from our policymakers and government from our leaders in the private sector our economists our academics others who can come together to the table and on behalf of america perform their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and our middle class keeps growing so government has to be smarter simpler more focused itself on longterm investments than shortterm politics and be a better partner to cities states and the private sector washington has to be a better steward of america’s tax dollars and americans’ trust and please let’s get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology that’s what i’ll do as president i will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality laughter i want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together and i will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable including by continuing to restrain health care costs which remain one of the key drivers of longterm deficits i will make sure washington learns from how well local governments businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across america you know passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress as president i will use the power to convene connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done because above all we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the longterm needs of our country i confess maybe it’s the grandmother in me but i believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade you’ll never sit and the vision i’ve laid out here today for strong growth fair growth and longterm growth all working together will get incomes rising again will help working families get ahead and stay ahead that is the test of our time and i’m inviting everyone to please join me to do your part that’s what great countries do that’s what our country always has done we rise to challenges it’s not about left right or center it’s about the future versus the past i’m running for president to build an america for tomorrow not yesterday an america built on growth and fairness an america where if you do your part you will reap the rewards where we don’t leave anyone behind thank you all thank you i just want to leave you with one more thought i want every child not just the granddaughter of a former president or former secretary of state but every child to be able to reach for her godgiven potential please join me in that mission — let’s do it together thank you all so muchthank you thank you all very much thank you thank you i’m delighted to be here at this great university one of the premier public institutions of higher education in our entire country yes indeed just you know one of those statements of fact that deserves a response i want to thank my longtime friend vice president mondale for his kind words his support in this campaign means a great deal to me personally because i admire so much his service to our country he is a great minnesotan and a great american and we’re so privileged to have him with us today i also want to acknowledge a few of the other elected officials who are here i am of course absolutely delighted to be joined by former colleagues and friends your senators amy klobuchar and al franken who are quite the dynamic duo for your state and i am grateful to them for everything they’re doing and for their help and support of my campaign i also want to thank tina smith your lieutenant governor and steve simon your secretary of state and i understand that betsy hodges is here mayor of minneapolis and i also want to acknowledge the dean of the humphries school eric schwartz eric was my top advisor on refugee issues at the state department i also had the great privilege of working with him when he was on the national security council during my husband’s administration you know he brings a mix of expertise and empathy that has been conspicuously missing from much of our public debate and i am grateful he is here today but i’m also a little jealous that all of you here at the university get to have the benefit of his experience you know over the past several months i have listened to the problems that keep american families up at night now most people don’t expect life to be easy but they do want more security a goodpaying job that lets you afford a middle class lifestyle health care you can count on a little bit put away for your retirement being secure also means being safe safe at home at school at work and today i want to talk about how we keep our country safe from a threat that’s on everyone’s minds the threat of terrorism but i want to begin by saying we cannot give in to fear we can’t let it stop us from doing what is right and necessary to make us safe and doing it in way that is consistent with our values we cannot let fear push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe americans are going to have to act with both courage and clarity now as we all know on december nd two shooters killed people at a holiday party in san bernardino california sadly in america in turning on the news and hearing about a mass shooting is not unusual but this one turned out to be different because these killers were a husband and wife inspired by isis americans have experienced terrorism before on / we learned that terrorists in afghanistan could strike our homeland from fort hood to chattanooga to the boston marathon we saw people radicalized here carrying out deadly attacks but san bernardino felt different maybe it was the timing coming so soon after paris maybe it was how random it seemed a terrorist attack in a suburban office park not a highprofile target or symbol of american power it made us all feel it could have been anywhere at any time the phrase “active shooter” should not be one we have to teach our children but it is and now we are all grappling with what all this means for our future for our safety our sense of wellbeing and our trust and connections with our neighbors we want to be openhearted and we want to celebrate america’s diversity not fear it and while we know the overwhelming majority of people here and around the world hate isis and love peace we do have to be prepared for more terrorists plotting attacks just yesterday a man in maryland was charged with receiving thousands of dollars from isis for use in planning an attack and here in minnesota authorities have charged ten men with conspiring to provide material support to isis but in the twin cities you have also seen firsthand how communities come together to resist radicalization local imams condemning terrorist violence local artists and activists pushing back against terrorist propaganda i just met with a group of community leaders who told me about some of the work and the challenges that they are dealing with as the first somaliamerican police sergeant in minnesota and probably in the country said recently “safety is a shared responsibility so we have to work together” the threat we face is daunting but america has overcome big challenges many times before throughout our history we’ve stared into the face of evil and refused to blink we beat fascism won the cold war brought osama bin laden to justice so no one should ever underestimate the determination of the american people and i am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear and we will defeat these new enemies just as we’ve defeated those who’ve threatened us in the past because it is not enough to contain isis we must defeat isis break its momentum and then its back and not just isis but the broader radical jihadist movement that also includes al qaeda and offshoots like al shabaab in somalia now waging and winning this fight will require serious leadership but unfortunately our political debate has been anything but serious we can’t afford another major ground war in the middle east that’s exactly what isis wants from us shallow slogans don’t add up to a strategy promising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn’t make you sound strong it makes you sound like you’re in over your head bluster and bigotry are not credentials for becoming commanderinchief and it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations including the top official at the treasury department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing every day that’s wasted on partisan gridlock could put americans in danger so yes we need a serious discussion and that’s why in a speech last month before the council on foreign relations i laid out a threepart plan to defeat isis and the broader extremist movement one defeat isis in the middle east by smashing its stronghold hitting its fighters leaders and infrastructure from the air and intensifying support for local forces who can pursue them on the ground second defeat them around the world by dismantling the global network of terror that supplies radical jihadists with money arms propaganda and fighters and third defeat them here at home by foiling plots disrupting radicalization and hardening our defenses now these three lines of effort reinforce one another so we need to pursue all of them at once using every pillar of american power it will require skillful diplomacy to continue secretary kerry’s efforts to encourage political reconciliation in iraq and political transition in syria enabling more sunni arabs and kurdish fighters to take on isis on both sides of the border and to get our arab and turkish partners to actually step up and do their part it will require more us and allied airpower and a broader target set for strikes by planes and drones with proper safeguards it will require special operations units to advise and train local forces and conduct key counterterrorism missions what it will not require is tens of thousands of american combat troops that is not the right action for us to take in this situation so there is a lot to do and today i want to focus on the third part of my plan how we defend our country and prevent radicalization here at home we need a comprehensive strategy to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack like the one in san bernardino first we have to shut down isis recruitment in the united states especially online second stop wouldbe jihadists from getting training overseas and stop foreign terrorists from coming here third discover and disrupt plots before they can be carried out fourth support law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to attacks and fifth empower our muslimamerican communities who are on the frontlines of the fight against radicalization this is a degree strategy to keep america safe and i want to walk through each of the elements from recruitment to training to planning to execution first shutting down recruitment we have to stop jihadists from radicalizing new recruits inperson and through social media chat rooms and what’s called the “dark web” to do that we need stronger relationships between washington silicon valley and all of our great tech companies and entrepreneurs american innovation is a powerful force and we have to put it to work defeating isis that starts with understanding where and how recruitment happens our security professionals need to more effectively track and analyze isis’s social media posts and map jihadist networks and they need help from the tech community companies should redouble their efforts to maintain and enforce their own service agreements and other necessary policies to police their networks identifying extremist content and removing it now many are already doing this and sharing those best practices more widely is important at the state department i started an interagency center to combat violent jihadist messages to have a better way to communicate on behalf of our values and to give young people drawn to those messages an alternative narrative we recruited specialists fluent in arabic urdu and somali to wage online battles with extremists to counter their propaganda now those efforts have not kept pace with the threat so we need to step up our game in partnership with the private sector and credible moderate voices outside government but that’s just some of what we have to do experts from the fbi the intelligence community homeland security dod the state department and the technology industry should work together to develop a unified national strategy to defeat isis in cyberspace using all of our capabilities to deny jihadists virtual territory just as we work to deny them actual territory and at the same time we also have to do more to address the challenge of radicalization whatever form it takes it’s imperative that the saudis the qataris the kuwaitis and others stop their citizens from supporting radical schools madrassas and mosques around the world once and for all and that should be the top priority in all of our discussions with these countries now second we have to prevent isis recruits from training abroad and prevent foreign jihadists from coming here most urgent is stemming the flow of fighters from europe and america to iraq and syria and then back home again the united states and our allies need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip and then share information with each other in real time right now european nations don’t always alert each other when they turn away a suspected extremist at the border or when a passport is stolen they have to dramatically improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism cooperation and we’re ready to help them do that we also need to take down the network of enablers who help jihadists finance and facilitate their travel forge documents and evade detection and the united states and our allies should commit to revoke the passports and visas of jihadists who have gone to join isis or other groups and bring the full force of law against them as i’ve said before the united states has to take a close look at our visa programs and i am glad the administration and congress are stepping up scrutiny in the wake of san bernardino and that should include scrutinizing applicants’ social media postings we also should dispatch more homeland security agents to highrisk countries to better investigate visa applicants for many years america has waived visa requirements for travelers from countries with reliable security procedures including key allies in europe and asia that makes sense but we also have to be smart except for limited exceptions like diplomats and aid workers anyone who has traveled in the past five years to a country facing serious problems with terrorism and foreign fighters should have to go through a full visa investigation no matter where they’re from we also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from syria guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas and it’s a process that historically takes to months but congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough possible process and just as important we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations turning away orphans applying a religious test that discriminates against muslims slamming the door on every single syrian refugee that is not who we are we are better than that it would be a cruel irony indeed if isis can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones so after rigorous screening we should welcome families fleeing syria just as the twin cities and this state have welcomed previous generations of refugees exiles and immigrants of course the key is to prevent terrorists also from exploiting our compassion and endangering our security but we can do this and i think we must third we have to discover and disrupt jihadist plots before they can be carried out this is going to take better intelligence collection analysis and sharing i’ve proposed an “intelligence surge” against isis that includes more operations officers and linguists enhancing our technical surveillance of overseas targets intercepting terrorist communications flying more reconnaissance missions to track terrorists’ movements and developing even closer partnerships with other intelligence services president obama recently signed the usa freedom act which was passed by a bipartisan majority in congress it protects civil liberties while maintaining capabilities that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep us safe however the new law is now under attack from presidential candidates on the left and right some would strip away crucial counterterrorism tools even with appropriate judicial and congressional oversight others seem eager to go back to discredited practices of the past i don’t think we can afford to let either view prevail now encryption of mobile devices and communications does present a particularly tough problem with important implications for security and civil liberties law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals warn that impenetrable encryption may make it harder for them to investigate plots and prevent future attacks on the other hand there are very legitimate worries about privacy network security and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit i know there’s no magic fix to this dilemma that will satisfy all these concerns but we can’t just throw up our hands the tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to keep us safe from terrorists and even as we make sure law enforcement officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks it’s essential that we also make sure jihadists don’t get the tools they need to carry out attacks it defies common sense that republicans in congress refuse to make it harder for potential terrorists to buy guns if you’re too dangerous to fly you’re too dangerous to buy a gun period and we should insist on comprehensive background checks and close loopholes that allow potential terrorists to buy weapons online or at gun shows and i think it’s time to restore the ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines i know this will drive some of our republican friends a little crazy you’ll probably hear it tonight they will say that guns are a totally separate issue nothing to do with terrorism well i have news for them terrorists use guns to kill americans and i think we should make it a lot harder for them from to do that ever again and there’s a question a question they should be asked why don’t the republican candidates want to do that you see i have this old fashioned idea that we elect a president in part in large part to keep us safe from terrorists from gun violence from whatever threatens our families and communities and i’m not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that’s not the right path for us to go down now the fourth element in my strategy is supporting law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks in san bernardino city county state and federal authorities acted with speed and courage to prevent even more loss of life like detective jorge lozano a year police veteran who assured terrified civilians “i’ll take a bullet before you do” there is no limit to the gratitude we owe to law enforcement professionals like that detective lozano who run toward danger to try to save lives and not just in the immediate wake of an attack our police firefighters and emergency responders will keep putting their lives on the line long after the cameras move on it’s disgraceful that congress has thus far failed to keep faith with first responders suffering from the lasting health effects of / many of them were men and women i was so proud to represent as a senator from new york the zadroga / health act never should have been allowed to lapse it looks like majority leader mitch mcconnell may have finally dropped his opposition and i hope the american people will hold him to that and we will continue to honor the service and sacrifice of those who responded to the worst terrorist attack in our history we have to make sure that local law enforcement has the resources and training they need to keep us safe and they should be more closely synced up with national counterterrorism experts including with better use of “fusion centers” that serve as clearinghouses for intelligence and coordination and we need to strengthen our defenses and our resilience wherever we’re vulnerable whether it’s “soft targets” like shopping malls or higherprofile targets like airports railways or power plants we have to build on the progress of the obama administration in locking down loose nuclear materials and other wmd so they never fall into the hands of terrorists who seek them actively around the world so we should be providing the department of homeland security with the resources it needs to stay one step ahead not trying to privatize key functions like tsa as some republicans have proposed and it’s important for us to recognize that when we talk about law enforcement we have made progress in being sure that our federal authorities share information with our state and local authorities but that was an issue i tackled after / and we have to stay really vigilant so that information is in the hands where it needs to be finally the fifth element in the strategy is empowering muslimamerican communities who are on the frontlines of the fight against radicalization there are millions of peaceloving muslims living working raising families and paying taxes in our country these americans may be our first last and best defense against home grown radicalization and terrorism they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it’s too late intervene to help set a young person straight they are the best positioned to block anything going forward that’s why law enforcement has worked so hard since / to build up trust and strong relationships within muslimamerican communities here in the twin cities you have an innovative partnership that brings together parents teachers imams and others in the somaliamerican community with law enforcement nonprofits local businesses mental health professionals and others to intervene with young people who are at risk it’s called the building community resilience pilot program and it deserves increased support it has not gotten the financial resources that it needs to do everything the people involved in it know they can do and we’ve got to do a better job of supporting it now i know that like many places across the country there’s more work to do to increase trust between communities and law enforcement just last month i know here a young african american man was fatally shot by a police officer and i understand an investigation is underway whatever the outcome tragedies like this raise hard questions about racial justice in america and put at risk efforts to build the community relationships that help keep us safe from crime and from terrorism when people see that respect and trust are twoway streets they’re more likely to work handinhand with law enforcement one of the mothers of the men recently charged with conspiring with terrorists said “we have to stop the denial” she told other parents that “we have to talk to our kids and work with the fbi” that’s a message we need to hear from leaders within muslimamerican communities across our country but we also want to highlight the successes in muslim american communities and there are so many of them i just met with the first somaliamerican council member of the city council here and he was proudly telling me how much change somali immigrants now muslimamericans have made in parts of the city and neighborhoods that had been pretty much hollowed out let’s look at the successes if we’re going to full integrate everyone into america then we need to be seeing all their contributions too and that is one of the many reasons why we must all stand up against offensive inflammatory hateful antimuslim rhetoric you know not only do these comments cut against everything we stand for as americans they are also dangerous as the director of the fbi told congress recently anything that erodes trust with muslimamericans makes the job of law enforcement more difficult we need every community invested in this fight not alienated and sitting on the sidelines one of the community leaders i met with told me that a lot of the children in the community are now afraid to go to school they’re not only afraid of being perceived as a threat they are afraid of being threatened because of who they are this is such a openhearted and generous community i hope there will be even more efforts perhaps under the aegis of the university and certainly governor dayton and others to bring people together to reassure members of the community particularly children and teenagers that they are welcome invited and valued here in this city and state now donald trump’s proposal to ban all muslims from entering the united states has rightly sparked outrage across our country and around the world even some of the other republican candidates are saying he’s gone too far but the truth is many of those same candidates have also said disgraceful things about muslims and this kind of divisive rhetoric actually plays into the hands of terrorists it alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against isis you know you hear a lot of talk from some of the other candidates about coalitions everyone seems to want one but there’s not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to build a coalition and make it work i know how hard this is because i’ve done it and i can tell you insulting potential allies doesn’t make it any easier and demonizing muslims also feeds a narrative that jihadists use to recruit new followers around the world that the united states is at war with islam as both the pentagon and the fbi have said in the past week we cannot in any way lend credence to that twisted idea this is not a clash of civilizations it’s a clash between civilization and barbarism and that’s how it must be seen and fought some will tell you that our open society is a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism i disagree i believe our tolerance and diversity are at the core of our strength at a naturalization ceremony for new citizens today in washington president obama noted the tension throughout our history between welcoming or rejecting the stranger it is he said about the meaning of america what kind of country do we want to be and it’s about the capacity of each generation to honor the creed as old as our founding e pluribus unum out of many we are one president obama is right and it matters it’s no coincidence that american muslims have long been better integrated and less susceptible to radicalization than muslims in less welcoming countries we can’t give in to demagogues who play on our basest instincts we must instead rely on the principles written into our american dna freedom equality opportunity america is strongest when all our people believe they have a stake in our country and our future no matter where they’re from what they look like how they worship or who they love our country was founded by people fleeing religious persecution as george washington put it the united states gives “to bigotry no sanction to persecution no assistance” so to all our muslimamerican brothers and sisters this is your country too and i am proud to be your fellow american and i want to remind us particularly our republican friends that george w bush was right six days after / he went to a muslim community center and here’s what he said those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take their anger don’t represent the best of america they represent the worst of human kind and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior so if you want to see the best of america you need look no further than army captain humayun khan he was born in the united arab emirates he moved to maryland as a small child and later graduated from the university of virginia before enlisting in the us army in june he was serving in iraq one day while his infantry unit was guarding the gates of their base a suspicious vehicle appeared captain khan told his troops to get back but he went forward he took ten steps toward the car before it exploded captain khan was killed but his unit was saved by his courageous acts captain khan was posthumously awarded the bronze star and purple heart he was just years old “we still wonder what made him take those steps” khan’s father said in a recent interview “maybe that’s the point” he went on “where all the values all the service to country all the things he learned in this country kicked in it was those values that made him take those steps those steps told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country” his father finished as hard as this is it’s time to move from fear to resolve it’s time to stand up and say “we are americans” we are the greatest nation on earth not in spite of the challenges we’ve faced but because of them americans will not buckle or break we will not turn on each other or turn on our principles we will pursue our enemies with unyielding power and purpose we will crush their wouldbe caliphate and counter radical jihadism wherever it takes root we’re in it for the long haul and we’ll stand taller and stronger than they can possibly imagine that’s what we do here it’s who we are that’s how we’ll win by looking at one another with respect with concern with commitment that’s the america that i know makes us all so proud to be a part of thank you all very much“thank you to richard and thanks for the great work that the council does under your leadership it truly is an important resource for us all fareed i look forward to having the conversation with you everyone here at the council and mr mayor thank you very much for being here and for everything you are doing and will do to keep our city safe and strong i am very grateful i wanted to come here to our city which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism to talk about the events of the past week and the work we must do together to protect our country and our friends when the united states was hit on / our allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all now it is our turn to stand in solidarity with france and all of our friends we cherish the same values we face the same adversaries we must share the same determination after a major terrorist attack every society faces a choice between fear and resolve the world’s great democracies can’t sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need therefore we must choose resolve and we must lead the world to meet this threat now let us be clear about what we are facing beyond paris in recent days we have seen deadly terrorist attacks in nigeria lebanon iraq and turkey and a russian civilian airliner destroyed over the sinai at the heart of today’s new landscape of terror is isis they persecute religious and ethnic minorities kidnap and behead civilians murder children they systematically enslave torture and rape women and girls isis operates across three mutually reinforcing dimensions a physical enclave in iraq and syria an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond and an ideological movement of radical jihadism we have to target and defeat all three and time is of the essence isis is demonstrating new ambition reach and capabilities we have to break the group’s momentum and then its back our goal is not to deter or contain isis but to defeat and destroy isis but we have learned that we can score victories over terrorist leaders and networks only to face metastasizing threats down the road so we also have to play and win the long game we should pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy – one that embeds our mission against isis within a broader struggle against radical jihadism that is bigger than any one group whether it’s al qaeda or isis or some other network an immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots will not be easily be torn outit will require sustained commitment and every pillar of american power this is a worldwide fight – and america must lead it our strategy should have three main elements one defeat isis in syria iraq and across the middle east two disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters financing arms and propaganda around the world three harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats let me start with the campaign to defeat isis across the region the united states and our international coalition have been conducting this fight for more than a year it is time to begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts to smash the wouldbe caliphate and deny isis control of territory in iraq and syria that starts with a more effective coalition air campaign with more allied planes more strikes and a broader target set a key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about isis and its operations so we need an immediate “intelligence surge” in the region including technical assets arabic speakers with deep expertise in the middle east and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with al qaeda in the past this would help us identify and eliminate isis’s command and control and its economic lifelines a more effective coalition air campaign is necessary but not sufficient and we should be honest about the fact that to be successful air strikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from isis like president obama i do not believe that we should again have a hundred thousand american troops in combat in the middle east that is just not the smart move to make here if we have learned anything from years of war in iraq and afghanistan it is that local people and nations have to secure their own communities we can help them and we should but we cannot substitute for them but we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission now the obstacles to achieving this are significant on the iraqi side of the border kurdish forces have fought bravely to defend their own lands and to retake towns from isis but the iraqi national army has struggled it is going to take more work to get it up to fighting shape as part of that process we may have to give our own troops advising and training the iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes ultimately however the ground campaign in iraq will only succeed if more iraqi sunnis join the fight but that will not happen so long as they do not feel they have a stake in their country or confidence in their own security and capacity to confront isis now we have been in a similar place before in iraq in the first sunni awakening in we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out al qaeda unfortunately under prime minister maliki’s rule those tribes were betrayed and forgotten so the task of bringing sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult but nonetheless we need to lay the foundation for a second sunni awakening we need to put sustained pressure on the government in baghdad to get its political house in order move forward with national reconciliation and finally stand up a national guard baghdad needs to accept – even embrace – arming sunni and kurdish forces in the war against isis but if baghdad will not do that the coalition should do so directly on the syrian side the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage isis – beyond the syrian kurds who are already deep in the fight – is that the viable sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting assad who let us remember has killed many more syrians than the terrorists have but they are increasingly seeing the threat from isis as well so we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership and to encourage more syrians to take on isis as well to support them we should immediately deploy the special operations force president obama has already authorized and be prepared to deploy more as more syrians get into the fight and we should retool and ramp up our efforts to support and equip viable syrian opposition units our increased support should go handinhand with increased support from our arab and european partners including special forces who can contribute to the fight on the ground we should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no fly zones that will stop assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air opposition forces on the ground with material support from the coalition could then help create safe areas where syrians could remain in the country rather than fleeing toward europe this combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the turkish border from isis choking off its supply lines it would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that secretary kerry is pursuing of course we have been down plenty of diplomatic deadends before in this conflict but we have models for how seemingly intractable multisectarian civil wars do eventually end we can learn lessons from lebanon and bosnia about what it will take and russia and iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability right now i am afraid president putin is actually making things somewhat worse now to be clear though there is a role for russia to help for resolving the conflict in syria and we have indicated a willingness to work with them toward an outcome that preserves syria as a unitary nonsectarian state with protections of the rights of all syrians and to keep key state institutions in tact there is no alternative to a political transition that allows syrians to end assad’s rule now much of this strategy on both sides of the border hinges on the roles of our arab and turkish partners and we must get them to carry their share of the burden with military intelligence and financial contributions as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in iraq and syria countries like jordan have offered more and we should take them up on it because ultimately our efforts will only succeed if the arabs and turks step up in a much bigger way this is their fight and they need to act like itso far however turkey has been more focused on the kurds than on countering isis and to be fair turkey has a long and painful history with kurdish terrorist groups but the threat from isis cannot wait as difficult as it may be we need to get turkey to stop bombing kurdish fighters in syria who are battling isis and become a full partner our coalition efforts against isis the united states should also work with our arab partners to get them more invested in the fight against isis at the moment they are focused in other areas because of their concerns in the region especially the threat from iran that is why the saudis for example shifted attention from syria to yemen so we have to work out a common approach in september i laid out a comprehensive plan to counter iranian influence across the region and its support for terrorist proxies such as hezbollah and hamas we cannot view iran and isis as separate challenges regional politics are too interwoven raising the confidence of our arab partners and raising the costs to iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against isis and as we work out a broader regional approach we should of course be closely consulting with israel our strongest ally in the middle east israel increasingly shares with our arab partners and has the opportunity to do more in intelligence and in joint efforts as well we should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is we have to fit a lot of pieces together bring a lot of partners along move on multiple fronts at once but if we press forward on both sides of the border in the air and on the ground as well as diplomatically i do believe we can crush isis’s enclave of terror and to support this campaign congress should swiftly pass an updated authorization to use military force that will send a message to friend and foe alike that the united states is committed to this fight the time for delay is over we should get this done now the second element of our strategy looks beyond the immediate battlefield of iraq and syria to disrupt and dismantle global terrorist infrastructure on the ground and online a terror pipeline that facilitates the flow of fighters financing arms and propaganda around the world has allowed isis to strike at the heart of paris last week and allowed al qaeda affiliate to do the same at charlie hebdo earlier this year isis is working hard to extend its reach establishing affiliates and cells far from its home base and despite significant setbacks it has encountered not just with isis and its ambitious plans but even al qaeda including the death of osama bin laden they are still posing rape threats to so many let’s take one example we have had a lot of conversation about isis in the last week let’s not forget al qaeda they still have the most sophisticated bombmakers ambitious plotters and active affiliates in places like yemen and north africa so we can’t just focus on iraq and syria – we need to intensify our counterterrorism efforts across a wider scope most urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the war zones of the middle east thousands thousands of young recruits have flocked to syria from france germany belgium the united kingdom and yes even the united states their western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home radicalized and battlehardened stemming this tide will require much better coordination and information sharing among countries every step of the way we should not stop pressing until turkey where most foreign fighters cross into syria finally locks down its border the united states and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to syria we also have to be smart and target interventions that will have the greatest impact for example we need a greater focus on shutting down key enablers who arrange transportation documents and more when it comes to terrorist financing we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions the un security council should update its terrorism sanctions they have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities but we have to place more obligation on countries to police their own banks and the united states which has quite a record of success in this area can share more intelligence to help other countries and once and for all the saudis the qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path toward radicalization when it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment we have to identify the hotspots – the specific neighborhoods and villages the prisons and schools – where recruitment happens in clusters like the neighborhood in brussels where the paris attacks were planned through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society – especially muslim community leaders – we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots radicalization and recruitment also is happening online and there is no doubt we have to do a better job contesting online space including websites and chat rooms where jihadists communicate with followers we must deny them virtual territory just as we deny them actual territory at the state department i built up a unit of communications specialists fluent in urdu arabic somali and other languages to do battle with extremists online we need more of that including from the private sector social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts so they are not used to plan provoke or celebrate violence online or offline the bottom line is that we are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate – and we have to win it now let’s be clear though islam itself is not our adversary muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism the obsession in some quarters with a “clash of civilizations” or repeating the specific words “radical islamic terrorism” is not just a distraction it gives these criminals these murderers more standing than they deserve and it actually plays into their hands by alienating partners we need by our side our priority should be how to fight the enemy in the end it didn’t matter what kind of terrorist we called bin laden it mattered that we killed bin laden but we still can’t close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous strain of extremism within the muslim world that continues to spread its adherents are relatively few in number but capable of causing profound damage – most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from north and west africa to asia overlapping conflicts collapsing state structures widespread corruption poverty and repression have created openings for extremists to exploit before the arab spring i warned that the region’s foundations would “sink into the sand” without immediate reforms well the need has only grown more urgent we have to join with our partners to do the patient steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law creating economic growth that supports stability working to curb corruption helping train effective and accountable local intelligence law enforcement and counterterrorism services as we do this we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more effective and adaptable than the terror networks we’re trying to defeat when i became secretary of state i was surprised to find that nearly a decade after / there was still no dedicated international vehicle to regularly convene key countries to deal with terrorist threats so we created the global counterterrorism forum which now brings together nearly countries many from the muslim world it should be a clearinghouse for directing assistance to countries that need it for mobilizing common action against threats and let’s not lose sight of the global cooperation needed to lock down loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons – and keep them out of the hands of terrorists at the end of the day we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot using all the tools at our disposal that includes targeted strikes by us military aircraft and drones with proper safeguards when there aren’t any other viable options to deal with continuing imminent threats all of this – stopping foreign fighters blocking terrorist financing doing battle in cyberspace – is vital to the war against isis but it is also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that now the third element of our strategy has to be hardening our defenses at home and helping our partners do the same against both external and homegrown threats after / the united states made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe we still have work to do on this front but by comparison europe is way behind today european nations do not even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border or when a passport is stolen it seems like after most terrorist attacks we find out that the perpetrators were known to some security service or another but too often the dots never get connected i appreciate how hard this is especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats but this has to change the united states must work with europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination european countries also should have the flexibility to enhance their border controls when circumstances warrant and here at home we face a number of our own challenges the threat to airline security is evolving as terrorists develop new devices like nonmetallic bombs so our defenses have to stay at least one step ahead we know that intelligence gathered and shared by local law enforcement officers is absolutely critical to breaking up plots and preventing attacks so they need all the resources and support we can give them law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities including in our own country muslimamericans this should go without saying but in the current climate it bears repeating muslim americans are working every day on the frontlines of the fight against radicalization another challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem we should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously they have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack on the other hand we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion network security and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit so we need silicon valley not to view government as its adversary we need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy now is the time to solve this problem not after the next attack since paris no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debated than how to handle syrian refugees seeking safety in the united states our highest priority of course must always be protecting the american people so yes we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from syria guided by the best judgment of our security professionals in close coordination with our allies and partners and congress needs to make sure the necessary resources are provided for comprehensive background checks drawing on the best intelligence we can get and we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in visa programs as well but we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and humanitarian obligations turning away orphans applying a religious test discriminating against muslims slamming the door on every single syrian refugee – that is just not who we are we are better than that and remember many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us it would be a cruel irony indeed if isis can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones we should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis not less we should lead the international community in organizing a donor conference and supporting countries like jordan who are sheltering the majority of refugees fleeing syria and we can get this right america’s open free tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism but i actually believe it is one of our greatest strengths it reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities this is not a time for scoring political points when new york was attacked on / we had a republican president a republican governor and a republican mayor and i worked with all of them we pulled together and put partisanship aside to rebuild our city and protect our country this is a time for american leadership no other country can rally the world to defeat isis and win the generational struggle against radical jihadism only the united states can mobilize common action on a global scale and that is exactly what we need the entire world must be part of this fight but we must lead it there’s been a lot of talk lately about coalitions everyone seems to want one but there is not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to make a coalition work in the heat and pressure of an international crisis i know how hard this is because we have done it before–to impose the toughest sanctions in history on iran to stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in libya to support a fledgling democracy in afghanistan we have to use every pillar of american power – military might but also diplomacy development aid economic and cultural influence technology and the force of our values that is smart power you have to work with institutions and partners like nato the eu the arab league and the un strengthen alliances and never get tired of oldfashioned shoeleather diplomacy and if necessary be prepared to act decisively on our own just as we did to bring osama bin laden to justice the united states and our allies must demonstrate that free people and free markets are still the hope of humanity this past week as i watched the tragic scenes from france i kept thinking back to a young man the world met in january after the last attack in paris his name was lassana a muslim immigrant from mali who worked at a kosher market he said the market had become a new home and his colleagues and customers a “second family” when the terrorist arrived and the gunfire began lassana risked his life to protect his jewish customers he moved quickly hiding as many people as he could in the cold storage room and then slipping out to help the police “i didn’t know or care” he said “if they were jews or christians or muslims we are all in the same boat” what a rebuke to the extremists’ hatred the french government announced it would grant lassana full citizenship but when it mattered most he proved he was a citizen already that is the power of free people that is what the jihadis will never understand and never defeat and as we meet here today let us resolve that we will go forward together and we will do all we can to lead the world against this threat that threatens people everywhere thank you all”for you and our team barack obama will be present the united states and the other half is to fill that position where they good strong principled conservative from one that we know here and to alabama who care after use nine year olds from here but throughout the united states of america and the world now weve got somebody who stars as in washington who shows those principles and shows his courage everyday for somebody like me congress to be able to look up to him to get his advice on important issues like immigration is a tremendous get it to give to all of us to have this man not just representing alabama but being the stalwart that he is united states senate is my great pleasure in my great privilege to represent you in the house of representatives i got to ride in the car from the airport was senator crews at saratoga me tell you about the people down here we go to church every sunday we try every day we dont say happy holidays we say merry christmas miss the veterans memorial day when somebodys is among those who served our country we thank them because we are americans and one of the greatest americans i have ever known someone whos done so much to serve our state and our country is some and im here and im honored to introduce your united states senator the honorable jeff sessions it is given some building and had me on his radio so show and he said and you must be very proud to represent such a people and i do have great honor and proud proud to represent you particularly pleased to welcome to our area this a cruise he is a friend and an ally will work together im so proud he saw came on a fabulous day like this gosh we know has to be a god in heaven live in a town in the community is pretty is this this time of the year let me just say a couple of times we ended its last session dismal and additional congressional session i appreciate bradley brad hes such a talented hardworking smart knowledgeable congressman and he stood firm against this bill as last time that weve been together on a lot of important issues one of the things that youve been hearing about somehow is a criticism of ted and how he and what he did with regard to this massive immigration bill if they tried to ram through in let me tell you i was there every step of the way with all my stuff i bought this legislation all the way through really dont they know now they not to let me just tell you a few things it just call people need to remember this because this election is going to the size of the crowd pushed that bale of hay in the white house and will they be able to continue their agenda i was somebody else be there it was saying no this is what happened after the battle you remember people started sending bridge to congress and to build a wall that fall into rang and rang and rang and i got sixty votes in the senate on the first preliminary vote and the second vote this shutdown millions of americans will call and we had a final vote had a final vote only voted for the people spoke and the congress finally although was dicey for a while responded here in same group again they spend a billion and a half dollars to promote this legislation they had political consultants pollsters hired and polling to try to spin the numbers in any way possible to advance this agenda they had special interest groups they met for months that gang of eight and they were determined they were gonna move this bill the past and it wasnt me wrong thing he was it worth still everybody would acknowledge i think that fire about it in the bill gave amnesty over a period of years even decades enforcement that if history follows a buyout would never have occurred we voted more than once to build a fence do we have a fence so i just cause you promise and so you gonna do something in washington you you know thats not so and so it came before the senate and the gang of eight met every day they also been meeting with the special interest groups that activist groups the lower rod the groups the aclu were active part of that and the business groups who want to lower morning or cheat life is not a healthy thing i gotta tell you know i was really worried about it and we had a big battle and i as they met they had us teen now playing and the plan was that they would go down every amendment no matter what the amendment why they want to do that because they said they had she through these secret meetings i delicate balance between enforcement may have the perfect bill and they could alter it in any way and every amendment that came up in the senate judiciary committee was voted down five eighths by partisan every democrat in a number of republicans voting with so i gotta tell you as it can stuff that the toughest most exciting and shanes out things that occurred was ted cruz and chuck schumer citizenship for the future ill never ever seen schumer who is very talented actually be flummoxed almost got to the point of the keys and taylor being anti hispanic kid you not but they would clear that was at central determining essence one of the things i wanted was citizenship for people who came here legally now look makes no sense you cannot provide the somebody who entered the country if you every bit of it illegally every benefit you give to somebody comes legally shirleys citizenship the capstone of what america gives out not to be given to people who entered the country in violation about very laws and they got a big voting comedian a pretty big boat and the floor of the senate but by then by then like i said you know you leave them at role in the sunshine long and it begins to stink and by the time it got to the house it was big in the same significantly in the house locked in and stopped it it was that close to being passed and i would say this i think i can say this with integrity and and and good judgment i believe without the vigorous opposition of ted cruz this bill likely wouldve passed so we need to thank him for that theyve got money interest groups power media support this agenda and the next president who gets elected is going to determine what kind of immigration system we have and we want a lawful system thats all the american people asking for a lawful system of immigration that is serves their interests american people im not against immigrants they dont hate immigrants later they dont believe we should have no immigration in america but they were all lawful system of smart system that people apply and they wait their turn and they get in and some dont get in and ill national security is protected and i jobs and wages are protected me state king and michael a and others who oppose his bill and only by to get differently it was critical to the success that weve had weve been together a lot of other issues and stood firmly on a number of critical battles the kind of wasteful spending that were being seen as a champion on that so without further ado here is my great honor to welcome to our beautiful area the state a great national leader ted cruz good friend jeff sessions thank you for the very very kind introduction and i want to say to the men and women of alabama principled conservative patriot who where all the money all the power in washington was arraigned on one side and a handful of conservatives were standing with the working men and women of this country on the other side and ill tell you when youre standing with the people of alabama we all spent a good chunk of the week washingtondc so it we have talented candidates for presidentbless the great state of iowa let me first of all say to god be the glory tonight is a victory for the grass roots tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across iowa and all across this great nation tonight the state of iowa has spoken iowa has sent notice that the republican nominee and the next president of the united states will not be chosen by the media will not be chosen by the washington establishment will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by but the most incredible powerful force were all sovereignty resides in our nation by we the people the american people thanks to the incredible hard work of everyone gathered here courageous conservatives across this state we together earn the votes of forty eight thousand six hundred and eight iowans to put into perspective youre incredible victory that you have one denied that is the most votes ever cast for any republican primary winner tonight is a victory for millions of americans who have shouldered the burden of seven years of washington deals run amok tonight is a victory for every american whos watched in dismay as career politicians in washington in both parties refused to listen in too often fail to keep their commitments to the people tonight is a victory for every american who understands that after we survived eight long years of the obama presidency that no one personality can right the wrongs done by washington the millions who understand that it is a commitment to the constitution to our shared insistence that we rise and return to a higher standard the very standard that gave birth to the greatest nation that the world has ever known revolutionary understanding that all men and all women are created equal there are rights do not come from the democratic party or the republican party or even from the tea party our rights come from our creator and the federal governments role the federal governments responsibility is to defend those fundamental rights to defend us and while americans will continue to suffer under a president who is set an agenda that is causing millions heard across this country i want to remind you of the promise of scripture weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning night iowa has proclaimed to the world morning is coming morning

a testament to the peoples commitments to their yearnings to get back to our core commitments freemarket principles constitutional liberties and the judeochristian values that built this great nation when the washington lobbyists settled on other candidates in this race when the media in one voice said a conservative cannot win nationwide over contributions poured in to ted cruz dot org as courageous conservatives said yes we can contributions that ted cruz dot org with an average contribution of that is the power of the grass roots but its more than that its volunteers here in the state of iowa its over volunteers all across this great nation in the course of this campaign people have asked idea me and i will admit it is hours a day six seven days a week we are not tired at all to the contrary we are inspired by each and every one of you to bed every morning amazed at a time when our country is in crisis every one of us has the opportunity to stand and lead that we have been put in a place of leadership for such a time as this im inspired stories of heroism that i see everyday working men like jerry dunleavy from columbus ohio who requested an entire month off his job to come to iowa to live at camp crews and a volunteer fulltime when his employer refused to give him the time off jerry quit his job and came anyway and i love the great state of iowa and inspired by people like elliott gazer and josh hammer students at the university of chicago who spent their winter break at camp cruise but they didnt stop there they came back this weekend they hit the phones and they hit the pavement campaigning so that students across this country upon graduation rather than having mountains of debt will instead have highpaying job offers and a chance at the american dream im inspired by people like alexander ziegler a thirteen year old girl from lubbock texas who yesterday and our campaign headquarters made eight hundred and twentythree volunteer calls that has always been the strength of this campaign are the men and women gathered here and courageous conservative standing up and speaking out and lifting us up in prayer lifting this country up in prayer each and every day and let me say our leadership team are iowa state chairman matt schultz what an extraordinary job you have done organizing a grassroots army and let me say they are iowa state director brian english what an amazing job brian is done and to our national cochairman bob vander plaats and steve king these men have become deer and trusted friends they are war years they are men of principle they stand and speak the truth they stand to defend their values and let me tell you these leaders day after day week after week have been crawling under broken glass with knives between their team im grateful for their support the early support of my friend steve days were grateful for the over one hundred and fifty pastors across the state of iowa who joined our team to energize people of faith we are grateful to the state senators to the state representatives to the volunteer leaders in each of the counties who stood up and said we will be heard and this will be decided by the grass roots and then i am so grateful to national leaders people like dr james dobson and tony perkins and phil roberts and governor rick perry and glenn beck leaders bringing together on coalescing conservatives here in iowa and all across the country you wanna know what scares the washington cartel actually not remotely i dont scare them in that tiny ass bit what scares them is you what scares them is that the old reagan coalition is coming back together up conservatives were seeing conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and reagan democrats all coming together as one

by the washington establishment and the washington cartel a candidate who had been dismissed outright by the media some polls had him fifteen to twenty points behind but you refused to let the establishment in the cartel and the media to your thinking for you you refuse to let them tell you how to vote you wanted a candidate who didnt adopt his positions because of the latest opinion polls but instead because of a deep an underlying conservative philosophy that grounded him so that he knew exactly what he believed exactly what the principles were that built this great nation so tonight i want to say to the people of new hampshire thank you for what you did thirtysix years ago thank you for giving america and the world and yes history itself our th president of the united states

tonight i want to say to every member of the democratic party who believes in limited government in personal opportunity in the united states constitution and a safe and secure america to the reagan democrats your party has left you and the republican party one shoe we welcome you back because together this year republicans in the reagan democrats can send an unmistakable message the message of a reagan like landslides that once and for all will drive the liberal elites and the washington cartel into the potomac and out to sea never to be seen again together we can bring out a new era of economic growth the military strength of international security and the future of hope that our children deserve if we commit to do more than hug if we aspire to govern by a higher standard as standard that trip transcends political party and race and gender and income and to everyone that is tired of a president that divides us daily on racial lines on ethnic lines on religious lines on

rules of engagement that are wrong that are immoral that will end in january you will have a commanderinchief who finally has your back and to the police officers and the fireman and the first responders the heroes who rushed into burning buildings instead of out of burning buildings the last seven years of having a president having an attorney general that demonizes you that vilified you that sides with the criminals and looters instead of the brave men and women of law enforcement that will end on january th so tonight the state of iowa the democrats here seem to be in a virtual tie between one candidate who admits hes a socialist and the other candidate who pretends shes not i wish them both luck but i will tell you this is margaret thatcher observe the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other peoples money and let me tell you tonight i cannot wait to stand on that debate stage with hillary clinton we will win by speaking the truth with a smile the truth theres the american people are fed up with washington with a corrupt class that enriches itself and leaves behind the working men and women of this country that growth is the american people are fed up with a federal government that views the bill of rights and the constitution as a rough draft as an inconvenience and something to be set aside and we are ready to get back to the vision of the framers protecting the unalienable rights given to each of us by our creator the reason i love you are here is the same reason i am here the same reason heidi and i spent every waking moment for the last year our girls carolina and catherine at age seven and age every one of us here when we go to bed at night we think what kind of world are we leaving our kids are we giving our children a brighter future are we giving our children what our parents gave us a country with greater freedom greater opportunity more promised more hope you wanna know why im got getting on a plane in about an hour and flying all night to new hampshire to knock on doors and sit down and visit with people and ask for their support the reason is simple because when i look my girls in the eyes ten twenty years from now i am not gonna tell him we could have stood up and save this country but we didnt do everything we could instead im gonna tell them millions of americans saw that america was in jeopardy and we rose up together and said we are going to preserve this nation for our children and grandchildren those who supported other candidates in this race the republican party is so blessed to have a bounty of talented young dynamic candidates people who are friends people who i like and respect to those who supported other candidates i will tell you each of them we welcome you as part of our team because if we stand together as one if the american people stand together and say we want our country back there is no horse in washington that can stand against the american people that can stand against the grass roots that can stand against our unity were gonna do this together as a movement from the people and i tell you tonight iowa has made clear to america and the world morning is coming morning is coming thank you and god bless youit is really good to be home thrilled to be back at prestonwood was somebody dear friends thank you for coming out today thank you for welcoming us all here thank you for this tremendous gathering you know this morning at the pulpit dr grand may have gone back to the original greek if you look to the anomalies you have the word politics there two parts holly meaning many and text me blood sucking parasites and that is a fairly accurate description of washington d c but you know ill tell you we all came out here this afternoon because i think we recognize that our countries in crisis i dont believe this is a typical time in politics a difficult time in our country we are bankrupting our kids and grandkids are constitutional rights are under assault each and every day has receded from leadership in the world and its making the world a much more dangerous place and yeah im here this afternoon with a whole world of hope and encouragement exhortation let me tell you people are waking up we are seeing an awakening we are seeing a spirit of revival process many things this taxes we can talk about the day we could talk about bringing back jobs and growth and opportunity we could talk about abolishing the irs the likud talk about repealing obamacare we could talk about standing unshakable with our friend and ally the nation of israel but i wanna talk to something close to home i want to talk about this press release liberty were seeing in this country religious liberty is under threat today like it never has been before in this nation you know ive been blessed to spend much of my adult life fighting to defend religious liberty together we defended the ten commandments monument on the state capitol grounds we went to the uss supreme court and we one nation under god has filed a lawsuit seeking to strike down the pledge we went to the ue supreme court and we won in representing over three million veterans pro bono for free defending the mojave desert better is more a lone white latin cross was erected over years ago to honor the men and women who gave their lives in ww the aclu filed a lawsuit seeking to tear it down the federal district court ordered that veterans memorial turned on the grounds it went out on appeal the federal court of appeals said you have to take the veterans memorial down they actually ordered that the cross be covered with a giant sack with a chain and padlock at the bottom well ill say this the court was were right in one regard the image of the cross has power and we won accelerated yeah well over a month ago i was proud to host a religious liberty rally in iowa over people come out in defense of religious where he was a single largest political event in iowa this year you know the media diminished threat to religious liberty to say its not real they say is made it made up dont worry about it we brought in nine heroes to simply tell their stories to tell their stories directly from the stage show typically a political event the candidates frontandcenter im very deliberately wanted to recede and a half each of those nine heroes tell their stories as a raisin jesus spoken parents what moves hard to tell what connects with who we are as people there were people like dick in very own garden couple of gotta know very well dick and bedding live in grimes iowa they are not historical lutheran church they started a business hosting legs and wonderful weddings and they did the catering they did the flowers and then a couple of years ago two men came in and they wanted to get married in the old guard church now the old guards are devout men in tights so they very polite flea a very respectfully said we cannot celebrate and host your wedding it is contrary to our faith the next day pursuit they spent months in litigation they pay over to settle the suit they promise never again to host another wedding in august he went bankrupt they laid off all their employees this month theyre auctioning off all of the property in the church im not a person who talked to the rally with kelton cochran and africanamerican grew up in an innercity a difficult home his whole life he wanted to be a fire and he achieved his dream he became a fire he rose to become the chief of the fire department in atlanta he then went to washington president obama pointed to a national fire board he moved to washington served in the obama administration and he came back to a land and resumed his role as chief of the fire department there was also a sunday school teacher and teaching sunday school again changing of the book of genesis and it particularly started focusing on the passage where god asked adam and eve who told you you were naked and it began thinking about what the word naked means not simply without clothes but without the covering of gods love gods redemption and he contrasted it all the places in the scripture where it talks about being closed righteousness close in jesus redeeming blood and end up writing a book based on his sunday school teachings called who told you you were naked and in that book about a page and a half of that book discusses human sexuality and what scripture says about that cochran was fired from his job for writing that book in his private time as a sunday school teacher for writing a book about what the bible teaches he was told you cannot be the fire chief of the city of atlanta i gotta tell you the entire event was three hours people nobody left it was i would encourage we have the whole thing online at crews dot org i would encourage you to watch it will lift your spirits to hear these stories these are ordinary keep a fireman floresta baker a tshirt maker ordinary people whose phase will face was tested pushed up and stood with god i believe is going to be a religious liberty election at the supreme court gay marriage oral argument last year justice alito asked the obama justice department is your position prevails will the next step be four the obama irs to go after christian universities that follow a biblical teaching on marriage and by extension christian grade schools like the school here preston or charities the answers from the obama justice department is yes that is a very real possibility the irs targeting those who follow a biblical teaching on marriage that is wrong it is not who we are but let me give you a word of encouragement as these threats road darker and darker and darker they are waking people up here in texas and all across this country i believe will be an election like my goodness you know how to fire people up you could be a preacher or something close well dr grand you can understand its even worse im happy to know that well my goodness you and i sat down with your beautiful wife heidi back in june and a lot has happened in the last five months and you you talked about your vision and your dream and put in your heart and were already seeing so much of that happen and the lord seems to be elevated you and giving you favor with people and youre certainly here in texas your back home and were really glad that you are ok thank on the religious freedom issue one of our concerns obviously is judicial activist i know this is something that youve talked about youre concerned about is well judges who seem to be making all rather than interpreting laws how do you view this and and how can we if you are present what kind of judges which you appoint particular supreme court justices we know elections matter is we talked about earlier this is one of the ways that matter but do we have a problem with judicial activism in this country is an enormous problem and it is growing if you look at in june the course of hours we had two decisions that were both early loss this a prank or a handful of unelected judges rewrote the text of obamacare ignore the federal statute to force that failed lawn millions of americans twentyfour hours later five unelected judges reported to tear down the marriage laws of all fifty says both of those decisions were lawless they were judicial activism theres not a word in the constitution that supports them really separates a number of the candidates running on the republican side in several of the republican candidates when the marriage decision came out put out statements that effectively says its the law of the land we need to accept it surrender and move on those are wordforword the talking points president obama i can tell you i for one do not accept it or not willing to surrender and im not willing to give up judicial appointments if you look at the core almost every democratic appointee on every big picture case they issued case votes a hundred percent the way the liberals want republicans weve had about many of the most egregious judicial activist earl warren william brennan john paul stevens david souter harry blackmun authored roe versus wade every one of those were republican appointees and the problem we run into the same problem over the last day i talked about two moments in time number one in george herbert walker bush had in one room data to other roomies jones the rockribbed conservative on th circuit court of appeals and bush went with sister and then in george w bushs similar choice said john robertson one room and had my former boss mike looting the rockribbed conservative on the floor circuit court of appeals in the other room and george w bush went with robert now in both instances it wasnt it the president bushs wanted to put a liberal on the court and one that but we need is jones and mike looting they have spent over a decade each on the court being a principled jurist following the constitution if you nominated them you would have a fight if you nominated and democrats would go nuts because theyd understand might looting was antonin scalia is first law clerks they know exactly what theyre gonna get and with david souter and john roberts the advantage was they have said very little they had no paper trail in every single time weve gone with a judicial nominee who doesnt have a paper trail is turned into another disaster so in the republican field in the republican candidates will sit down with you and tell you i will appoint strict constructionist who will follow the constitution and not legislate from the bench those of the talking points every candidate says the difference is whos willing to actually spend the camp and fight to do what they say i have spent my entire adult life fighting judicial activism there are few if any choices things that so many people are upset about is sending people in washington who dont get things done who say one thing and doing nothing and one of the things that we have appreciate about you is your willingness to go and stand on your principles and even when youre criticized her uncompromising so when people talk about being an outsider and at the same time you were a senator and a very good one how do you how does that work for you you youve been going up against sometimes im sure your head against iraq but how have you been able to manage this is present how can you change in this way yes cecilia is a great question you know im very encouraged by what we see if you look at that the republican presidential primary i think one of the most tremendously helpful thanks to my campaign has been donald trumps candice for one thing it certainly made it interests donald has really frame the central issue in this primary as who will stand up to washington now fast the central issue the natural next question is ok who actually has stood up to washington i cant think of a better question to decide this race because in that regard my record is markedly different from that of anyone else on that couple of examples in when when millions of americans rose up against the disaster that is obamacare i was proud to lead that fight you look to the other republican standing on that stage and then the question naturally arises when you look to when millions of americans rose up against president obamas he legal executive annis once again i was proud to lead that fight and once again you look to the other very fine men and women on this occasion you ask where were they and and hear it you dont have to go back to or go back to a couple weeks ago dr grand you remember that debate in california just about every republican look to the tv camera and say we should defund planned parenthood policy say that just two weeks ago we had a knockdown dragout fight in washington millions of americans rose up again against planned parenthood pastors all over the country lit up the phones i was proud to lead the fight against planned parenthood you look at the other folks to everyone who spoke so passionately the debate my national question is where were they can you imagine how different it eleven republican presidential candidates descended on washington and spoke in unison and said mitch mcconnell and john boehner dont send five hundred million dollars of taxpayer money that courage ok in the last presidential election many evangelical christians did not vote yes ive heard all kinds of numbers may be up to a million for whatever reason sat out not inspire maybe a little bit of washington that he call it political fatigue whatever i do says people are fired up now yes and that were ready to do a lot better and while someone suggests that evangelical christians are splintering and that were really not that committed and so on what what do you say about that and do you believe christians members of churches should engage in the political process talk to us a little bit about citizenship and our responsibility as you view it to to get to the polls to get involved in the process well i think it is absolutely vital i think the entire election turns on that question you know many of the folks here now my father has to rafael course for those who did you know that i am the shy softspoken one in the family as you know my father has has a real calling two other passengers and and several years ago god really put a burden on his heart that no one bears greater responsibility for where this country is today than the pastors and its a hard message was not an easy message to hear to deliver but he travels in space of pastors conference is all over the country and then the message my dad says he says you know if the flock stumbles into a ditch you dont blame the sheep died in the shop and theyre too many masters unfortunate as my father says who hide behind the pulpit you dont do what youre doing now were just sending off an encouraging the body of christ we have a responsibility show there about ninety million evangelicals and evangelical christians in america in the election fiftyfour million evangelical students out of the evangelical christians believers are staying home if were allowing our leaders to be elected by nonbelievers is it any wonder we have a federal government is assaulting life and marriage volatile over cause hows that working out and how do you propose to fix it let me start it is a disaster it is a train track and we should repeal everywhere that washington doesnt want to do that you know i wrote a couple of months about all the time for truth where where i talked about why the washington cartel career politicians in both parties to get in bed with lobbyists and special interests and grow and grow progovernment washington does not want to repeal obamacare the only way to do it is to make this election a referendum on repealing obamacare do you think of the election i often invoked the election i think we are reliving history in powerful ways can you imagine ronald reagan if he had come in to this church in and he has said dr graham were gonna cut the top marginal tax rate from seventy percent to percent were gonna go from stagnant economic growth to booming growth millions lifted into prosperity are hostages will be released from around the day im sworn into office and we need years will win the cold war and share the berlin wall of the graft way with all dismissed him as a not changed because under reasonable assessment washington was that possible what reagan did in nineteen eighty is he made it a referendum the reagan revolution change the incentives in washington twp that tax rate from to he did it with tip oneill a democrat as speaker of the house and the reason is simple theres an old joke that politics is hollywood for other people resemble that remark but the way you get things done the way you repeal obamacare and pass commonsense health care reform as you change the incentives so that you come out of november with a mandate from the people thats what causes republicans and democrats to say i am standing in the way of that and thats how we turn around my regular person there you go again you know ronald reagan came to this city i guess who was and he said to a group of evangelicals james robison was there a part of gathering a group he said look i know you can endorse me but i can endorse you and were so thankful for your endorsement of values that you hold yourself and the values that we share so one final question is how does your your personal faith strength in your life where you get discouraged and this fire this passion that you have welcomed in my faith is is an integral part of who i am you know often on the trail ill share my testimony and you know for me my testimony begins actually when i was a very young child with my parents for those of you all that and then no my dad now you didnt know him when he was young man what i was two and three years old my parents neither one of them christians they were living up in countering and both of them drank too much and when i was three my dad left us a decided he didnt want to be married anymore in one of his father to a threeyearold son and i got on a plane and flew down to houston and he was there a couple of months and a colleague from the oil and gas business invited my dad to a bible study and it was at the home of a local life insurance agent for whatever reason my father went and he described being struck by the piece he saw that i will stay remember there was one woman who talked about her son would beat her to get money for drugs and yes she had with scripture calls the peace that passes i understand and my father couldnt understand it it didnt make sense germany nearly didnt have any really want and that night at the end of the bible study they said well what are coming tomorrow night a lot of questions why dont you come tomorrow night you can talk with our pastor came back the next night case they three four five hours till late in the night arguing my father was convinced he was an atheist he was convinced he knew this got stuff was all gooey and he could disprove any went through question after question after question and at the end of the night he said alright whos never heard of jesus and the pastor very wisely didnt take the bait and he said i dont know about them and to that but youve heard jesus whats your excuse and and he fell to his knees he gave his life to jesus he went got in the car drove to the airport by plane ticket and flew back to calgary today with my mother and me so when people ask about the role of faith i can tell you in my life if it were not for the redemptive love of jesus christ i i would have been raised by single mom without my dad now and ill tell you just a raid and incredible at palazzo i i think an impression when i was agent that same church clay road baptist church gallon while it was the pastor let my dad to the lord baptized me and a couple of months ago on the campaign trail i was intense see it so happened that kaelin while he has retired tennessee and he came out to the rally and and i had not seen him in in years i was years old when i last saw it was a powerful i i felt up to have the opportunity opportunity just brother while and say thank you if you had to share the gospel with my dad my entire life and my familys life would have been different we know the rest of the story of how your character has been formed how can we pray for you and your family going forward you know id say three things peace and wisdom but then also especially if you and pray for our girls you know our girls here somewhere there were here carolina so theyre seven and four they are the joys of our life but i will tell you the hardest part of this campaign is being on the road being you know this this week ive been in dec iowa houston california new hampshire here and headed to austin san antonio and back to dec so the girls drove up to be with us for a couple of hours and two girls are it is hard on them and so that i will begin prayers that they know they are loved all of our heart and love by god as well howd you like the ideatax reform and regulatory reform every time we take the boot of government off the back at the next of small businesses the result is incredible economic growth small businesses is where job growth comes from twothirds of all new jobs come from small businesses you wanna destroy jobs and opportunity do what weve done the last seven years hammer small businesses each and every day and the people who are struggling struggling on the flip side you want to unleash incredible booming economic growth tax reform and regulatory reform of the two levers over and over again that work but in the nineteen twenties under calvin coolidge happened in the nineteen sixties under jfk happened in the nineteen eighties under ronald reagan regulatory reform pulling the burden of washington office small business and the most important regulatory reform is we need to repeal every word of obamacare president we will repeal obamacare and we will pass commonsense health care reform that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable and keep the government from getting in between us and our got his tax reform the simplest and best tax reform is waiting to pass a simple flat tax where every american can fill out his or her taxes on a postcard will wait do that we should abolish the irs the second key to reignite the promise of america is defending our constitutional rights for seven years weve had a president administration that targets the constitutional rights of the american people that violates our rights let me say here and now the constitution and bill of rights are not a rough draft they are not suggestions they are not an inconvenience to be ignored as sadly this president has been of them rather is the presidents responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully execute when a president and a federal government that defends the bill of rights all of them to defend the first amendment free speech and especially especially especially religious liberty you want to see just how far off the rails weve gone you dont need to look any further the little sisters of the poor little sisters of charity of nuns theyve taken vows of poverty they spend their lives caring for the poor elderly right now the obama administration is litigating against the little sisters of the poor trying to impose millions of dollars of fines on the sisters in order to try to force the nuns to pay for abortioninducing drugs and others yeah let me give you a very simple rule of thumb if youre litigating against you probably done so the wrong way this works really well down the street pull out the check list ok litigating against nuns check do not do that we need to defend the second amendment the right to keep and bear arms couple of weeks ago the of president obama announced yet more illegal executive orders trying to undermine our nd amendment right to keep and bear arms the very first thing i intend to do on my first day in office his wrists and every single illegal and unconstitutional and also on that first day and i intend to instruct the department of justice and the irs and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty and today we need to defend the fourth and fifth amendments our rights to privacy how many of yall hear your cell phones let me ask you please leave your cell phones on i wanna make sure president obama here as everywhere calls it the one the fundamental protection that says the powers not given the federal government are reserved to the states and to the people that means theyre certain responsibilities the federal government has given it needs to do the well winning to defend this nation keep this nation say rebuild our military lead to secure the borders and and sanctuary cities but there are a whole bunch of other areas that the federal government has no business sticking its nose and chief among those is education and waiting to repeal everyone on a conference call and then a reigniting the promise of america is winning to restore americas leadership in the world for seven years americas received from leadership in the world and it has made the world a much more dangerous place instead of a president who boycotts prime minister netanyahu imagine america standing unapologetically with the nation of israel we will have a commanderinchief who says to the world we will defeat radical islamic terrorists will have a president willing to utter the words and we will not weaken we will not degrade we will utterly and completely destroy you may be thinking can we do this you know scripture tells us theres nothing new under the sun and where we are today is very very much like the late nineteen seventies like the jimmy carter administration failed economic policies same feckless and chinese foreign policy in fact the exact same countries russia and around openly laughing out of marking the president united states now why is it that that analogy gives me so much hope and optimism because we remember how that story and all across this country millions of men and women rose up and became the reagan revolution and it didnt come from washington washington despised groundbreaking began right here in new hampshire with the men and women live free or die state disregarding the media disregarding the washington establishment and standing together behind ronald reagan and it changed the course of history the reason im so optimistic the same thing is happening again people are waking up it took jenny car to get us ronald reagan convinced the most long lasting legacy of barack obama will be a new generation of leaders in this country and the republican party who stand and fight for freedom who stand to the constitution but if you dare christian values that have made this country great and with that im happy to answer or dodge the question you live exactly what you feel is best prepared to be you know everyone of us i suspect its frustrating because we keep getting burned by politicians we keep having politicians who talked of the game on the trail but then they go to washington and they dont do what they said they would do they dont walk the walk you know we were told in if only we had a republican house of representatives then things would be different millions of us rose up we want a republican house and nothing changed we were told the problem was the senate if only we had a republican senate if only we were tired harry reid then things would be different millions of us rose up to do exactly that we want a republican senate and very little we cant get burned again the stakes are too high in so how do we not get burned again to suggest you the best test applied to apply to listen to what any of us dont listen to what i say dont listen to any other candidate since instead follow the biblical teaching you shall know them by their fruits of every candidate dont tell me show me show me where you stood and fought show me where youve walked the walk so if you want a president who will repeal obamacare asked which candidate has stood up and let the fight against obama if you want a president wholl stop and who will secure the borders and keep this country safe dont let the door campaign promises instead ask in when the democrats and the republican establishment were pushing and thats it and the steel plant whose student led the fight with the american people to defeat amnesty and a fight to secure the boers if you want a president who will defend the bill of rights will defend the first of a man who will defend the second amendment dont listen to our promises listen everyone says they support the second amendment republican primary including moderate and liberal republicans are used to favor gun control even they say they will support the second so dont listen to us instead ask in the spring of when barack obama and harry reid chuck schumer came after the second amendment right to keep and bear arms when they proposed aggressive new gun control regulations where were you just stand and fight it you lead the fight to just stand with the american people are you nowhere to be found the reason why we had the result we didnt get that completely flabbergasted the media is the voters are a lot smarter than the media gives us credit and what were seeing happening is were saying that old reagan coalition coming together were seeing conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and reagan democrats all coming together and the reason is that were looking for a consistent conservative were tired of being burned and the reason that conservatives are uniting behind our campaign is that i have a proven record of standing and fighting but the constitution for the bill of rights for conservative principles and the voters dont want to listen to empty words they wanted amanda consistent conservative someone we can trust absolutely wonderful small business owners have been happening in washington washington is fundamentally corrupt the reporters some regularity that they say a lot of times cruise sounds like bernie sanders in many ways i agree with burning in diagnosing the problem the problem ive said many times that they justified weve got politically its not gonna crafts and republicans its between career politicians in washington in both parties and the american people and what we see in washington is the washington cartel is career politicians getting in bed with the lobbyists and special interests growing big business growing the money to powerful influences with with influence and power in the administration and the people who are losing the little guys the people who are losing our the small business owners the people who are losing the people who are struggling to achieve the american dream now were burning on differences solution the solution to government being fundamentally corrupt is to have a whole lot more government does not but i agree with the problem and so you know you notice in this republican primary that every candidate says theyll stand up to washington the natural followup question to ask is ok who who has stood up to washington when did you take it on not just democrats but leaders in your own party because you know you do so you get pounded by democrats you get pounded by republicans get pounded by the media if you are now who will take on washington then you should ask the simple question who is washington attacking right now and the commitment that obvious to you is that i dont work for the party bosses in washington i dont work for the obvious i dont work for the washington establishment i dont work right now for twenty seven million texans and if elected president my job im here to job interview im asking to work for you and the commitment on get to you is that i will fight every day for you or your freedom for your right to run a small business for your economic growth and for keeping government the heck off your back so the campus and have a better view absolutely yes yes maam thank you very much for that question and right before the race sean hannity did as well and and and and sean pointed out he said he said he really had no choice to endorse me because he said every day for two weeks mark called him and said she knows whats wrong with you dont get the concept would leave me alone the question you know this supreme court we have a red radical an activist supreme court right now but is out of control this supreme court is we are one justice away from a five justice left wing radical majority the likes of which this country is never see details some of the consequences of what they find justice majority would be so therefore i was in the center was the solicitor general in texas which is the chief lawyer for the state in front of the uss supreme court held that post for five and a half years its an executive post and during that time wed led fighting for conservative principles nationwide over and over and over again and won over and over and over so for example we defended the ten commandments monument stands on the state capitol grounds been there since we went to the supreme court and we won upholding that monument we are one justice away from the supreme court ordering the ten commandments torn down in state capitals and courthouses all over the world saying you cannot acknowledge god in the public square when i was solicitorgeneral we led a coalition of thirtyone states before the uss supreme court defending the second amendment right to keep and bear arms and we we are one justice away from a decision let me take the position of the dissenters in that decision it was not that some gun control laws or are permissible position of the dissenters was much more radical than that the dissenters four justices said the second amendment does not protect any individual right whatsoever it is only whats called a quote collective right of the militia which is fancy lawyers are nonexistent right we are one justice away from the supreme court concluding that no individual in this room has any right at all of the second amendment that the federal government could make it a criminal offense for any of us to possess a firearm and we would have no right under the constitution a challenge that law justice away from them if hillary clinton has elected president the second amendment will be erased from the constitution if we elect a feckless republicans who is not willing to put principled conservative jurist on the core we could rest the second amendment being erased and i wont mention one other case the biggest case of my years solicitor general was a case called million versus texas many began with horrific crime in houston where two teenage girls were horribly assaulted and murdered by gang one of those gang members jose ernesto that he was an illegal alien to come from mexico when he was three and the case took a very strange turn because the world court which is the judicial arm of the united nations issued an order to the united states to reopen the convictions of murders including that we went to the ue supreme court and thought the world court in the united nations i argue this case twice in front of the supreme court on the other side we had ninety foreign nations we had two world court where the united nations and we had to present the united states and im sorry to tell you the president was not barack obama it was george w bush in george w bush signed a twoparagraph order that reported to order the state courts to evade the world court now tell you i had an interesting conversation my boss at the time was greg abbott the attorney general is now the governor of texas we sat down and had a conversation it was an unusual position for texas to the arguing against the president the united states before the supreme court particularly when the president was a texan was a republican was the former governor of our state it was a friend i am proud to tell you that i went before the supreme court and argued that the world court and united nations have no jurisdiction whatsoever over the united states of america president of the united states republican or democrat has the constitutional authority to undermine usc won before the supreme court the supreme court struck down the world courts order struck down the presidents order but we are one justice away from the supreme court concluding that our sovereignty can be given away to the united nations thats what the stakes are and the sad reality is when it comes to supreme court nominees democrats everyone votes left wing need almost every single time republicans by about weve been a disaster theres a reason for that theres actually its not that were bad its that the people we elect dont care about so the judgment they make is if you nominate a principled conservative democrats can actually care about this is they will fight tooth and nail so what happens is republicans say let me find a stealth cant let me find someone who has no paper trail whos never said or done anything to prove their conservative by the way if youve lived fifty years of your life and you never said or done anything to prove your conservative by some miracle you might be maybe the supreme court of the united states is not the best place to find out what happens is presidents decide that you want to spend the political capital i dont have a fight with congress on conserving on on nominating someone who has a proven record as a conservative jurist so ill take the easy route my favorite just as i would say its a threeway tie between antonin scalia clarence thomas at my former boss who i clerk for chief justice william rehnquist all of whom have been principled conservative jurists and ill tell you one of the biggest and most important differences i think between me and the other people running is that i have spent my entire adult life fighting judicial activism fighting to defend the constitution fighting to defend the bill of rights and unlike other candidates running other republicans who i think wont be willing to spend the political capital get this right i give you my solemn word every justice that i put on the court will be a principal constitutionalist who will be faithful to the law and who will not legislate from the bench enormous commitment of time and energy and love and it is a great affirmation every day of just how much your parents love you that they will spend their time raising you and teaching you and sharing their values with you listen i have been a passionate defender of homeschoolers for decades i think it is a fundamental right of every parent to educate your child to teach your values your face the state has no business getting in between you and your child and one of the keys to that is we should abolish the federal department of education money send it back to the states and the reason is education is too important it is the key to opportunity it is the key to getting to the american dream and i think the people of new hampshire know much better what should be done with the children who hampshire then do some bureaucrats in the bowels of the department of education at the state level or even better question yes sir thank you for your service to choose his or her doctor bill the navy and the air force in the army and marines were gonna rebuild our ship level airplanes level were gonna increase our readiness you know morale right now is so unbelievably low and its because weve got a commanderinchief it doesnt believe in our fighting men and women that doesnt have their back that send them into combat with rules of engagement where both arms are tied behind their back i think that is grotesque i think it is immoral it when we have to use military force we should use overwhelming power kill the enemy and get the heck out of here to every active duty military member here to every mom or dad or husband or wife or son or daughter of someone who is serving always wondered are they gonna come home i give you my word in january we will have a commanderinchief who will stand by the fighting men and women of this country theyre back that the stakes have never been higher than its now or never that we are at the edge of a cliff and if we keep going this same direction and other for eight more years we risk doing irreparable damage to the greatest country in the history of the world if you agree with me on there then i asked you to do three things number one join us commit right now and come out on february to vote in the new hampshire republican primary vote with us if we stand together we will win number to bring others others commit right now to pick up the phone call your mom such a good idea to call your mom anyway call your sister or your son or your next door neighbor your say this election matters matters for me it matters for my future it matters for my kids and grandkids i want to ask everyone here to vote for me ten times democrats not suggesting voter fraud but if everyone here gets nine other people to show up and vote in the primary you love voted ten times you know what if youre not old enough yet developed you get people to show up and vote in the primary voted ten times before you turn thats how we win we unite the old reagan coalition we can together as one and the third thing i wanna ask each of you is that you pray that you commit each and every day from that election day to lift this country spent just a minute today saying father got please continue this awakening continue the spirit of revival all this country back from the abyss we are here today standing on the promises of second chronicles my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear their prayers from heaven and will forgive their sins and i will heal their land that our friends in the mainstream media will never share with you in january when ronald reagan took the oath of office is left hand was resting on nd chronicles the very real and concrete manifestation of that promise from the word of god we have seen these challenges before we have faced the episcopal and the american people came together pulled this country back we had done it before and if the people of new hampshire stand together as one we can do it again and we can bring that lacks fastmister president theres a reason the american people are fed up with washington there is a reason the american people are frustrated the frustration is not simply milder passing ephemera it is volcanic over and over again the american people go to the ballot box over and over again the american people rise up and say the direction were going doesnt make sense we want change over and over again the american people win elections in a tidal wave election in a tidal wave election and yet nothing changes in washington mister president id like to share with you and the american people the real story of what is happening in washington why is it that our leaders cannot stop bankrupting this country cannot stop the assault on our constitutional rights cannot stop americas retreat from leadership in the world the very simple dynamic when you have two sides allegedly in a political battle one side that is relentlessly unshakable e committed to its principles and the other side that reflexively surrenders at the outset the outcome is for day i will give president obama in the senate democrats credit they believe in principles of big government they believe in this relentless assault on our constitutional right and they are willing to crawl over broken glass with a night between their teeth to fight for those those principles unfortunately leadership on my side of the aisle does not demonstrate the same commitment to principle now how is it you might wonder that a preemptive surrenders put in place well it all begins with a relatively innocuous statement there shall be no shutdown that is a statement leadership in both houses republican leadership in both houses said were not gonna shut the government down and you know you can understand the folks in the private sector folks at home that sounds perfectly reasonable except heres the reality in washington and todays washington there are three kinds of those there are number one show bones boats that are brought up largely to placate the voters where the outcome is for our day when most republicans will vote one way most democrats will though the other republicans will lose and the conservatives who elected republican majorities in both houses are supposed to be thrilled that theyve been patted on the head and given their show vote that was destined to lose we had a vote like that in recent weeks and weeks on planned parenthood leadership told us you should be thrilled we voted on it what else do you want we voted on in a context where it would never happen and indeed it didnt the second kind of vote our votes that simply grow government that dramatically expand spending expand corporate welfare and those votes mister president those votes pass because you get a bipartisan coalition of republican leadership and democrat both of whom are convinced that career politicians will get reelected if they keep growing and growing government in particular handing out corporate welfare two giant corporations oh boy if youve got the lobbyists and pastry pushing for something you can get votes in this chamber his republican leadership loves it and democrats are always willing to grow government and then theres a third kind of a vote on mustpass legislation in an era when one side the democratic party is adamantly committed to continuing down this path is causing so many millions of americans to her must pass votes are the only votes that have real consequences this chamber they typically fall into one of three categories either continuing resolution or an omnibus appropriation bill or a debt ceiling increase each of those three are deemed must pass votes and if you actually want to change law those are the only hopes of doing so but i mentioned before youve got one side that has preemptively surrendered republican leadership has said we will never ever ever shut down the government and suddenly president obama understand the easy key to winning every battle he simply has to utter the word shut down and republican leadership runs to the hills so president obama demands of congress find every bit of obamacare of it and do nothing zero for the millions of americans who are hurting millions of americans have lost their jobs lost their health care of lost their doctors whove been forced into parttime or millions of young people whove seen their premiums skyrocket president obama says you can do nothing for the people that are hurting senate democrats say we dont care about the people who are hurting will do nothing for them and heres the kicker president obama promises if you try to do anything on obamacare i barack obama will veto funding for the entire federal government and shut it down and republican leadership compliant lee says okay fine well fund about president obamas an understanding hes got a pretty good trump card here he can pull out any time so next he says ok republicans fund my unconstitutional executive amnesty is contrary to law its flouting federal immigration law but you republicans funded anyway or else i barack obama will veto funding for the entire our federal government shutdown and republican leadership says at the outset ok well find that most are now you turn to planned parenthood over barack obama this will surprise no one says fund of planned parenthood with taxpayer money mind you planned parenthoods a private organization is not even part of the government but it happens to be politically favored by president obama and the democrats planned parenthood is also the subject to multiple criminal investigations for being caught on tape apparently carrying out a pattern of ongoing felonies in ordinary times the proposition that we should not be sending your advice federal taxpayer money to fund a private organization under multiple criminal investigations that ought to be a one hundred and nothing vote but i mentioned before barack obama is absolutely committed to his partisan objectives he is like the terminator he never stops he never gives up he moves forward and forward and forward so what does he say if you dont find this one private organization thats not part of the government thats under multiple criminal investigations i barack obama will veto funding for the entire federal government and shut it down and what is republican leaderships a little surprised no one republican leadership says we surrender we will fund planned parenthood president obama has negotiated a catastrophic nuclear deal with iran republican leadership does on television all the time and rightly says this is a catastrophic deal the consequences are that its the single greatest national security threat to america millions of americans could die mr president i would suggest if we actually believed the words that are coming out of our mouths then we would be willing to use any and all constitutional authorities get into congress to stop a catastrophic deal that sends over billion dollars to the ayatollah khamenei but yet president obama says hell veto the entire budget if we do and to the surprise of nobody republican leadership surrenders you know ill draw an analogy mister president it is if at a football game the beginning at a football game the two team captains go out to flip the coin and one teams coach walks out and says we forfeit and they do it game after game after game right of the coin flip leadership says we forfeit we surrender we republicans will find every single biggovernment liberal liberal priority the democrats now if the team did that if an nfl team did that over games they would know what their record with it would be a and you know id be pretty sure that the fans who bought tickets who went to the game would be pretty ticked off as they watch their coach forfeit over and over and over and over again you want to understand the volcanic frustration with washington its that republican leadership in both houses will not fight for a single priority that we promised the voters we would fight for when we were campaigning less than a year ago you know this past week was a big newsweek in washington speaker of the house john boehner announced he was going to resign there was lots of speculation in the media as to why the speaker of the house resigned as president tell you why you reside its actually a direct manifestation of this disconnect between the voters back home and republican leaders speaker boehner and later mcconnell had promised there will be no shutdown so therefore they will fund every single priority of barack obamas we are right now voting on whats called a clean see are now i will note it is clean only in the parlance of washington because what does it do it funds of obamacare of executive amnesty it funds all of planned parenthood funds the iranian nuclear deal it is essentially a blank check to barack obama thats not very clean to me that actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill funding priorities that are doing enormous damage now in the senate the votes were always there for a dirty cra cra that funded all about obamas priorities are democrats a little vote for tech course they will theyve got the other side funding their priorities of course every democrat will vote for that over and over and over again and twice on sunday and the simple reality on the republican side as when leadership joins with the democrats about half of the republican caucus is happy to move over to that side of the aisle so the votes were always preordained now the motion i may just a moment ago was a motion to table the treaty member filling the tree something we heard about a lot in the previous congress harry reid the democratic leader did it all the time senators on this side of the aisle stood up over and over again instead of using process likely even campaigned our leadership saying were gonna have an open amendment process and yet whats happened here majority leader mcconnell has taken a page out of leader reads label and filled the tree i moved to table the tree and what you then saw was leadership denying a second and what is denying a second denying a recorded vote why is that important as president when you are breaking the commitments made to the men and women who elected you most painful thing in the world is accountability when you are misleading the men and women who showed up to vote for you you dont want sunshine make it clear that you voted no a recorded vote means each senators name is on it now why did i moved the table but recently to add the amendment that i attended which would have number one said not one penny goes to planned parenthood and number two not one penny goes to implementing this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal unless and until they comply with federal law the administration complies with federal law and hands over the full deal including the side agreements with a friend what you saw was republican leadership desperately does not want a vote on that mr president i intend tomorrow to make that motion again and when i make that motion again i would encourage those watching to see which senators are here to give a second or not and devote yay or nay i would note by the way when you deny a second which is truly an unprecedented procedural trick it used to be that was a courtesy that was afforded to all senators indeed in the opposing party routinely over and over again when a democrat or republican ask for a second everyone raises their hand what leadership is discovered we can do this in the dark night but i would encourage those watching to see number one when this motion is offered again who shows up to offer a second and who either doesnt raises hand or just doesnt come to the floor one of the ways you avoid accountability is your somehow somewhere else doing something really really important instead of actually showing up to the battle that is raging right here and now but i would also encourage people to watch very carefully what happens after that after that you have a voice vote still a vote lets be clear standing here on the floor there were two senators senator lee and i voted up to voted to table to table the tree and take up the amendment barring funding for planned parenthood and barring funding for this catastrophic iranian nuclear do the remaining senators on the republican side yard leader mcconnell you had whipped corning senator alexander you senator talk those four senators voted loudly know its still a vote even though its not recorded though to vote on the senate floor so why did speaker boehner resign i mentioned to you that the votes were always cooked here the democrats + republican leadership in the votes that they bring with them ensure plenty of votes for a dirty crc are in the funds obamacare the funds amnesty the fund planned parenthood that funds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal but the house was always the bulwark mister president youll remember in we had a fight over obamacare he was serving in the house the time and that fight we never had the votes in the senate actually this and it was under control of the democrats they were going to do anything they could defend obamacare regardless of millions of people hurting but the house was the bulwark in that fight any particular there was a score of or strong principled conservatives who care deeply about honoring the commitments they made to the men and women elected that that was always the strength we had that fight you know its been interesting reading some of the press coverage speculating that there would be some magic parliamentary trick that would somehow stop this corrupt deal while in the senate there are no magic parliamentary tricks when you have the democrats + republican leadership in a chunk of the republicans those votes can roll over any parliamentary trick you might use even with the blood moon we just had there are no mystical powers that allow you to roll over that but in the house we still got that strong conservatives so how is it that speaker boehner and leader mcconnell could promise there will never ever ever be shut down because i believe speaker boehner has decided to cut a deal with leader nancy pelosi the leader of the democrats that this juror tcr that can be passed out of the senate gonna go to the house and the speakers gonna take it up on the floor passed it with all the democrats just like leader mcconnell just hit and a handful of republicans who will go with republican leadership a very significant percentage of republicans will vote no but heres the problem speaker boehner done that or the ones and in this instance there were too many republicans who were tired of seeing their leadership leave the democrats rather than lead the republican party i believe a speaker that boehner had done that had passed a dirty see our funding planned parenthood funding this iranian nuclear deal that he would have lost a speakership a member of the house had introduced a motion to vacate the chair that house republicans were fed up with their leader not leading at least not leading their party leading the democratic party to speaker boehner faced a conundrum if he does what he and later mcconnell promised which is funded all of barack obamas priorities he would have lost his job and so what did he do he announced that he is resigning as speaker and resigning as a member of congress that is unsurprising but it also telegraphs the deal that hes just cut it a deal to surrender and join with the democrats notice he said hes gonna stay a month hes going to stay a month in order to join with the democrats and fund barack obamas priorities now lets talk about some of the substantive issues that we ought to be talking about lets start with planned parenthood past couple of months a series of videos have come out about planned parenthood now to some of the people watching this you may never seen the videos why is that caused the mainstream media has engaged in a virtual media blackout on the abc nbc cbs last thing they want to do is show these videos you watch fox news you can see the videos but the mainstream media in the great tradition a problem wants to make sure the citizenry doesnt see whats in these videos i would encourage every american republican or democrat regardless of where you fall on the right to life even if in fact especially if you consider yourself prochoice just watch these videos go online and watch them and ask yourself are these my values is this what i believe these videos show senior officials from planned parenthood lasting sipping chardonnay and callously harmlessly selling the body parts of unborn children over and over and over again one senior officials caught on video laughing and saying she hopes she sells enough body parts of unborn children to buy herself a lamborghini again i would suggest just ask yourself for these my values and another video a lab tech describes a little baby boy unborn board in about two pounds his heart still beating she was instructed to insert the scissors under his chin to cut open the face of this little boy and harvest his brain because the brain was valuable planned parenthood sell the brain this is something that a brave new world this is human beings that little boy at heart was still beating had a brain that was being harvest and he had a salt given him by god almighty he was made in the image of god and we are now a nation that harvest the body parts of little baby boys and girls is the very definition of inhumanity to treat children like agriculture to the ground and killed for their body parts to be sold for product now there is a reason that the media the democrats dont want these videos shown does anyone watching these videos will be hardfought but theyre not just terrific theyre also promised facie evidence of criminal activity there are multiple federal statues criminal statutes that planned parenthood appears to be violating perhaps on a daily basis the first and most direct is a prohibition on selling the body parts of unborn children for profit federal criminal law makes it a felony with up to years in jail time now these videos show very clearly selling body parts they also show them bartering overpriced now argue it wasnt for a profit but you watch these videos you watch the undercover buyers saying how much will you give me for them you see the planned parenthood officials say how much can i get i dont wanna bargain against myself on its face thats evidence of bargaining for a product you want the highest price you can get its not tied your costs tied to whatever dollars whatever revenue you can bring in and planned parenthood is the largest abortion provider in this country as another one of these videos reflects it is a lolium business planned parenthood taking the lives of unborn children and then selling them apparently forprofit it is also a federal criminal offence to alter the means of an abortion for the purpose of harvesting the organs of the unborn child thats a separate offense on video after video you see planned parenthood officials say ok what part would you like we can perform a different abortion depending on what part you want us to harvest on the videos they essentially admit to this crime they are filmed in the end theres the third criminal offense that provides you cannot harvest the organs of an unborn child without informed consent from the money and yet again these video seemed to indicate that planned parenthood treats informed consent as a technicality that is sometimes complied with and sometimes ignored now i will say mister president as an aside ordinarily when a national organization is caught on film committing a pattern of felonies the next steps are predictable the department of justice opened an investigation the fbi shows up and seizes their records everything on those video suggests those felonies are still occurring today what does it say about the obama justice department that no one on the face of the planet believe theres any chance the justice department would even begin to investigate what does it say about the most lawless partisan department of justice that youve got this group a its a political ally the president so thats apparently all that matters if its an ally of the president it doesnt matter that their videotape committing felonies department of justice will not even look at it you know im an alumnus of the us department of justice i was an associate deputy attorney general i spent much of my adult life working in law enforcement department of justice has a long distinguished record of remaining outside of partisan politics of staying above the partisan fray of being blind to party or ideology and simply enforcing the law and the constitution im sorry to say under eric holder and loretta lynch the department of justice is completely besmirched that tradition no one remotely believes that the obama justice department will even begin to investigate this pattern of felonies you dont see democrats suggesting no one in the media suggest and by the way if this were a republican administration and the entity but admitted to a pattern of feelings was a private entity that supported republicans you would see on cbs nbc abc an indictment clock every night he would see the anchors saying when will this investigation open when will they be indicted instead the media attends these videos dont exist in the face of what appears to be a national criminal enterprise were faced with a much simpler question will we continue to pay for it will we continue to pay for it with your own my tax dollars will we sent five hundred million dollars a year to a private organization to use to fund this ongoing criminal organization and whats the position of the democrats hear no evil see no evil they do not care what democrats do you see calling for the enforcement criminal laws against planned parenthood what democrats do you see saying at a minimum lets not spend taxpayer money to fund this not one not a single democrat stood up and said that let me ask you mister president what happens if planned parenthood gets indicted because even though the us department of justice under president obama has become little more than a partisan arm of the democratic national committee there are state local prosecutors are investigating planned parenthood right now if planned parenthood has indicted to the democrats maintain their wall of silence say were going to continue to fund them under indictment by all indications yes you havent heard a single democrats say well if theyre indicted then well stop the response mister president from our leadership is we cant win this fight thats the response they say well we cant win the planned parenthood fight why cuz we dont have sixty votes because we dont have those mister president if thats the standard than republican leadership standard is we will only do whatever harry reid nancy pelosi print thats what it means you dont understand why the american people are frustrated we were told if only we had a republican house of representatives and things would be different millions of us rose up incredible numbers and one in historic title win election mister president you were a youth pastor called the ministry and yet you stood up and said my countries in crisis im gonna stand forward answer the election was historic and yet very little changed then we were told ok weve got a house of representatives but the problem is the senate as long as harry reid as majority leader we cant do anything over and over again washington graybeards would go on television and in gravely tones they would say you cannot govern with onehalf of onethird of government the house of representatives is not enough but if we had the senate then things would be different the problem is harry reid mister president you recall during the fight over obamacare a number of members of this body republican said no no no no no we cant fight on obamacare we have to wait until we have a republican senate to fight to the american people obliged in millions of us rose up the second tidal wave election in a period of four years we senate sees we retired harry reid as majority leader who won the largest majority in the house of representatives since the nineteen twenties its been now for nine months since weve had republican majorities in both houses and i ask you mister president what exactly have those republican majorities accomplished now taking this present ive asked that question all over the country and townhomes ive never been in a town hall where the response spontaneously was not absolutely nothing thats true in every state of visitors and sadly my response over and over again as you know its worse than that i wish the answer absolutely nothing it would have been better if the republican majority said done absolutely nothing because what in fact that theyve done the very first thing that happened right after that election in november we came back to washington republican leadership joined up with harry reid the democrats and passed a trillion dollar chrome to the spill it was filled with poor corporate welfare group government grew the debt then republican leadership took the lead in funding obama than republican leadership took the lead in funding executive and then republican leadership took the lead in funding planned parenthood and then astonishingly republican leadership took the lead and current confirming loretta lynch as attorney general mister president which one of those decisions is one iota different from what would have happened with harry reid the democrats in charge of this change those decisions are identical and i would note by the way with loretta lynch the republican majority could have defeated that nomination the senate majority leader could have done so and yet she looked at the senate judiciary committee she looked at the senate when asked how she would differ from eric holders justice department the most lawless and partisan justice department ever seen she said no way whatsoever when asked to point to a single instance in which hed be willing to stand up to president obama to stop his lawlessness to stop his abuse of power she could not identify any circumstance in which she would ever stand up to the president who appointed her attorneys general from both parties have done that for centuries now with eric holder said it could be forgiven because his lawlessness manifested primarily after he was confirmed with the red line she told us beforehand she looked as in the eyes and say hey im gonna do exactly what my predecessors and republican leadership confirmed or anyone is it any wonder the american people are frustrated undermines we keep winning elections and the people we put in office dont do what they said they would do now some people across the country ask me is republican leadership just not very capable not that companies are they are unwilling to fight the presidents neither are actually quite competent and theyre willing to fight the question is what theyre fighting for theres a disconnect right now the or i go to our home state will go to any gathering of services we put up a white four and we ask the citizens the room give me the top priorities you think republican majorities in congress should be focusing we wrote twenty priorities that came from the citizens of oklahoma the citizens of texas or for that matter the citizens of any of the states those top priorities at least eighteen of them would appear nowhere on leadership priority list on the other hand if you drive just down the street in washington to k street k street is a street in washington where the lobbyists primarily resigned whether officers are if you get a gathering of corporate lobbyists that represent giant corporations and you ask them their top priority since the list that comes out or not just bear passing similarity it will be identical to the priorities are republican leadership thats the disconnect you know why were not here fighting on this because not getting taxpayer money to planned parenthood is not among the priorities of the lobbyists on k street leadership is not interested in doing thats the disconnect leadership doesnt know how to fight just a couple of months ago dealing with the export import bank we saw leadership in both chambers done extraordinary lengths herculean procedural step to try to reauthorize a classic example of corporate welfare hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer guaranteed loans the giant corporations now for that leadership is incentivized those corporations hire lobbyists and those lobbyists distribute checks typically by the wheelbarrow and there is no incentive greater in this body than getting reelected in the view of leadership is you get reelected by raking in the cash and you think weve gotten trillion dollar national debt as the way you reach bipartisan compromise in this body today in the broken world of washington did you grow and grow and grow government you sit around and roomies sale spent for your product prior to your prior to your prior to your prior another trillion dollars and were not the only people that loser your children in mind the only people that loser the next generations who find themselves mired deeper and deeper and deeper in debt i think my little girls carolina catherine little stop what were doing your children in my children will face a depth so crushing they wont be able to spend in the future for the priorities of the future for their needs for their wants for whatever crises come up with the next generation confronts theyll spend their whole lives simply working to pay off the debts racked up by their deadly parents and grandparents generation in history has ever done this to their children and grandchildren are parents didnt do it to us their parents didnt do it to them the reason is the corruption of this town and it boils down to a simple proposition the democrats are willing to do anything to push their priorities and the republicans the leadership is not listening to the men and women who elected us but its actually an even deeper problem that on the democratic side the major donors that fund the democratic party they dont despise their base the billionaires who write the giant cheques that fund president obama and hillary clinton and the democrats on that side of the aisle they dont despise the radical gay rights movement of the radical environmentalist movement all the people that knock on doors and get democrats elect the simple reality is a very large percentage of the republican donors actively despise our base actively despise the men and women who showed up and voted you and me and all i can tell you when you sit down and talk with a new york billionaire republican donor and i have talked with quite a few new york billionaire republican donor california republican donors their questions start out as follows first of all you gotta come out for gay marriage you need to be prochoice and you need to support analyst thats where the republican donors are you wanna what you wonder why republicans wont fight on any of these issues as the people writing the checks agree with the democrats now mind you the people who show up at the polls who elected you and me and elected this republican majority far too many of the republican donors look down on those voters as a bunch of ignorant hits in rooms while leadership like showboat you know it wasnt too long ago when the washington cartel was able to basketball with a showboat or two and they tell the rooms back home see we voted on it we just dont have the votes you know when i was first elected to this body many times i heard more senior senators saying some variation of the following now ted thats what you tell folks back home you dont actually do it heres whats changed the course of gotten more informed i now understand the difference between show votes in a real dont understand the vote we had a week ago on planned parenthood was designed to lose to placate those silly folks think we shouldnt be sending taxpayer funds to a criminal organization that is selling the body parts of unborn children but on the actual vote that could change policy leadership has no interest in fighting whatsoever you know the past couple of weeks one of my colleagues sent me a letter that really embodied the leadership message this letter said explain to me how you get sixty seven votes to defund planned parenthood you cant produce i wont support it mister president if that is our standard then we should all be honest with the men and women who elected us we do not have republican votes in this chamber and theres no realistic prospect of are getting votes anytime in the foreseeable future if the standard is unless you get sixty seven votes republican leadership will support mill policy issues in each of us only run to tell the voters to vote for me i will support whatever policy agenda harry reid nancy pelosi decide because thats my standard if i dont have votes deal ever recall harry reid the democrats saying how can we get republican votes their side is absolutely committed to their principles you dont see them holding back at all if the standard is how do we get votes name one thing that leadership will fight for well the answer i mentioned the three types of those theyll fight for big government will fight to grow government the fight to expand corporate welfare well that can indeed get votes but ive never been to a town home once where citizens said to me the problem is we dont have enough corporate welfare i need more subsidies for big business if a hundred percent of the agendas republican leadership is more subsidies for big business what the heck are you and i doing in the senate in the first place thats certainly one why i ran out when will you ran either you dont have to win every fight you dont have to fight everything you do have to stand for something and lets look beyond planned parenthood for a minute lets look to around all of the decisions that the obama administration has made there maybe none more damaging than this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal if this deal goes through there will be three consequences number one the obama administration will become quite literally the worlds leading financier of radical islamic terrorists now when i said that a couple of months ago president obama got very very upset he said it was ridiculous that i would say such a thing but despite attacking me directly president obama didnt actually endeavor to refute the substance of what i said so lets review the facts back number one erroneous today the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism that fact is understood even by this administration if this deal goes through over billion dollars will go directly to a ran to the ayatollah khamenei in fact number three if that happens billions of those dollars will go to hamas and hezbollah to the routines to radical islamic terrorists across the globe will use those billions to murder americans to murder israelis and murdering europeans presidents worth remembering fourteen years ago this month horrific terrorist attack that was carried out on september osama bin laden hated america but he never had billions of dollars you never had a hundred billion dollars the ayatollah khamenei hates america every bit as much as osama bin laden it and this administration is giving him control of over billion dollars imagine what bin laden could have done look at the damage he did with terrorists carrying box cutters now imagine that same delatorre with billions of dollars behind it the consequences of this deal could easily be another terrorist attack that dwarfs september th and scale that kills far more than the roughly lives that were snuffed out who in their right mind would send over billion dollars to a theocratic zealot who chanted death to america a second consequence of this catastrophic deal is that were abandoning for hostages four american hostages in iranian jails pastor saeed abedini an american citizen his wife now may lives in idaho i visited with now many times faster site has two little kids desperately want their daddy was sentenced to eight years in prison for the crime of preaching the gospel just last week was a three year anniversary of pastor saeed imprisonment reports are that hes being horribly mistreated that his health is failing and yet president obama cannot bring himself to utter the words pastor saeed abedini hundred billion dollars to the ayatollah khomeini and pastor saeed abedini remains in prison also in prison is amir hekmati an american marine president has a banded also in prison is jason resident a washington post reporter i know to the reporters in the gallery a colleague viewers abandoned by president obama in an iranian prison thrown in jail for doing his job reporting on the news and robert levinson his whereabouts remain unknown why does the president refused even to honor their names third consequence of this deal is this deal will only accelerate irans acquiring nuclear weapons now the administration claims that the deal will prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons why because they promised not to do it we have learned from a rare they break their promises over and over and over again and what we do now is that theyll have an extra hundred billion dollars to develop nuclear weapons with now i will say the administration is laughingly suggested well theyll use that on infrastructure to rebuild their roads to rebuild their energy industry right now theyre sending vast sums to hamas and hezbollah funding terrorism across the world and they had the same infrastructure needs another hundred billion dollars you dont think theyre going to find an awful lot of it to developing nuclear weapons and i would point out it is not by accident that the ayatollah khamenei refers to israel is the little satan in tehran is the great see americas the great see this is the one thread on the face of the earth that poses a real possibility of millions of americans being murdered and flash but i know everything im saying republican leadership said over and over again and yet republican leadership refuses to enforce the terms of the iran review legislation federal law that the administration is defined by not handing the entire deal over ive laid out a clear path a detailed path that leadership can follow to stop this d leadership refuses to do so instead we had a showboat that was designed to lose and it did exactly what we expected the democrats by and large put party loyalty above the national security of this country above standing with our friend and ally the nation of israel about protecting the lives of millions of americans if we really believe what so many of us have said that this poses the risk of murdering millions of americans is there any higher priority the most powerful constitutional tool congress has the power of the purse if we had the ability to stop this deal and we dont and millions of americans died how do we explain that to the men and women who elected us im not advocating that we fight willy nilly im advocating that we fight on things that matter dont give five hundred million dollars to planned parenthood a corrupt organization that is taking the lives of vast numbers of unborn children in selling their body parts in a criminal conspiracy directly contrary to federal law and dont give a hundred billion dollars to the ayatollah khomeini who seeks to murder millions in both instances those are defending life and yet republican leadership is not willing to lift a finger if only all the people who might be murdered by a nuclear weapon could create a pack in washington and hire some lobbyists maybe leadership would listen to them then but the truck driver at home the waitress at home school teacher at home the pastor the police officer working men and women the washington cartel doesnt listen to them and ill note with this deal is headed in december when this journey continuing resolution expires leadership is already foreshadowing they plan to bust the budget caps why we talked about at the beginning barack obama has discovered he says the word shut down and republican leadership screen surrenders and run to the hills above my understanding that quite well says you dont bust the budget caps ill shut the government down and republicans in this bizarre process republican leadership will blame whatever obama dozen other republicans you notice how much energy leader mcconnell devotes to attacking conservatives you notice how much energy speaker boehner devoted to attacking conservatives just yesterday to speaker of the house went on national television and on national television he directed an obscene epithets may person hes welcome to insult whomever he likes i dont intend to reciprocate but when us leadership ever showed that level of venom that level of animosity to president obama and the democrats who are bankrupting this country who are destroying the constitution are endangering the future of our children and grandchildren who are retreating from leadership in the world and have created an environment that has led to the rise of radical islamic terrorists you wanted a dynamic mister president weve seen and fight after fight this area read the democrats sit back and laugh why because its republican leadership that leads the onslaught attacking conservative saying no you can and we wont do anything to stop obamacare no you cant we wont do anything to stop amnesty no you cant we wont do anything to stop planned parenthood no you cant we wont do anything to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons if republican leadership really believes we can accomplish nothing and why does it matter if you have a republican house or senate every two years come october november we tell the voters it matters intensely to paraphrase phrase the immortal words of hillary clinton what difference does it make if the standard for republican leadership is anything that gets votes will support that means harry reid nancy pelosi remained a defector leaders of the set in the house and i would note by the way if in december leadership goes through with their promise to bust for the prom promise but their suggestion to bust the budget caps they would have done something astonishing historically the three legs of the conservative still have been fiscal conservatives social conservatives national security conservatives between planned parenthood iran and the budget caps leadership will have managed to abandon all three no wonder the american people are frustrated no wonder the american people do not understand why leadership isnt listening to themmuch for welcoming us here thank you for your hospitality thank you everyone for coming out this morning let me say to bill and bob thank you for your tremendous leadership thank you for leading our team here on the ground and new hampshire thank you for the incredible work you have done assembling a grassroots army jack thank you for your leadership helping bring conservatives together you know were seeing in new hampshire across the country were seeing the old reagan coalition coming together week ago with an extraordinary win we had all the pundits on tv said we couldnt win a member sunday night a week ago watching every tv station every pundit said there was no chance crews cant win give up on it its hopeless it will not happen again on happened one after the other after the other after the other and then just one thing they forgot the people and the men and women of our was put the country on notice that the media are not gonna pick the republican nominee or the next president and the washington establishment is the next president the united states instead it will be so encouraging is that reagan coalition we saw the coming together of conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and reagan democrats and young people all coming together now you look at the results on election night we won overwhelmingly among concerns we won overwhelmingly among evangelical but we also won among reagan democrats and we also won among young people thats the diverse array we need to win the nomination but also to win and here in new hampshire were seeing that same reagan coalition coming together you know just yesterday we received the support of five new hampshire representatives who have been part of rand pauls team as we see the liberty movement coalescing and just this morning were pleased to announce state senator kevin abar rand pauls new hampshire state chairman has endorsed this campaign is standing with us as well and i gotta tell you when the reagan coalition comes together when the liberty movement is standing with tea partiers is standing with small business owner is standing with republican women is standing with evangelicals is standing with conservatives that becomes a move from the people that scares the living daylights out of washington dcs just have this its worth reflecting on our campaign we were the only major candidate to compete in the state of iowa foursquare opposed to the ethanol now its conventional wisdom is that political suicide in iowa thats like coming up to new hampshire and campaigning against the new england papers just to be clear im not doing this but all the conventional wisdom said you cannot compete unless youre for the ethanol mandate not only by two leading competitors who finished second third welfare will expended someone hold out a certain very very shy developer from new york city prompted the republican governor of iowa area these guys are fine they will all keep the cronyism going but that will actually end the washington rock it works the governors son the major ethanol lobbyists who ran millions of dollars of attack ads blasting us for opposing yet that all mandate for daring to stand for a level playing field with no mandates no subsidies for anyone all of the above energy in a fair and even playing field without washington picking winners and losers then the results on election day but their country with their children but the future put the bankrupting of our kids and grandkids if were going to turn around the trillion dollar debt that is bankrupting the next generation weve got to be willing to say no to the washington cartel say no to the cronyism say no to the corporate welfare say no to the bipartisan corruption in washington to the constitutional principles that built this country and its worth observing internal no money money night on the republican side we had the highest turning in history higher than the last record shattered turnout records on the democratic side their turnout was thirty percent lower than heard that on the nightly news in almost kind of make sure one year what political party the reporters are members of you know we keep hearing feel the burn so many wisecracking most of them are not fit for missus mixed company but the democratic turnout dropped the republican turnout rose in a purple state like iowa and you know who was coming up in reagans every day as i can paint across the country i see men and women to come up to me and say im a democrat up in a democrat my whole life just a few days ago here in new hampshire to town hall gentleman came up to me said im a union carpenter please dont tell my union boss on here but he said you know what were doing that make any sense on with you you know today the first time in history a majority of americans believe that our kids will have a worse life than that has never been the case in the history of this country until right now may be the most unamerican idea you can imagine i believe the central issue in will be reigniting the promise of getting back to that fundamental ideals that our kids live a better life than we did in their kids better life when we get back to the free market principles of constitutional liberties that built america you know the great thing about internal drews carol is true three keys reigniting the promise of america number one we bring back jobs and growth and opportunity and number one priority is economic growth why is that because economic growth is foundational to every other challenge weve got if you wanna turnaround unemployment if you want to pay down the national debt if you want to rebuild our military you want to strengthen and preserve social security and medicare it gotta have growth with grossly can do all of that without rose and the folks here understand cause and effect you understand that every time we go down the path were on now that a control spending and taxes and regulations you get what weve got now misery and stagnation malaise it does not work and what hillary clinton bernie sanders promised more of the same more spending more taxes more debt and if we do that we only get more stagnation more misery more young people coming at his school with loans up to their eyeballs not able to get a job every time the federal government is pursued tax reform and regulatory reform every time it is pulled the boot of the federal government off the backs of the next of small business the result has been incredible economic growth and was true in the calvin coolidge was true in the nineteen sixties with jfk was true in the nineteen eighties with ronald reagan regulatory the single most important regulatory reform is we need to repeal every word of obamacare obamacare is the biggest job killer in america and we need to pass commonsense health care reform that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable and he government from getting in between us and our doctors and then the simplest and best tax reform is waiting to pass a simple flat tax taxes on a postcard we do that we should abolish the irs you know gosh in the live free or die state its almost like the irs is not a beloved institute a second key to reigniting the promise of america is we need to defend our constitutional rights instead of the federal government violating our rights attacking the rights of lawabiding citizens we need a president who will stand and defend the entire bill of rights we need to defend the first amendment free speech and especially especially especially religious liberty you know if you understand just how far off track our country is gone you need look no further the little sisters of the little sisters of the poor are a catholic charities of nuns who devote their lives to caring for the poor in the open right now today the obama administration is litigating against the little sisters of the poor trying to impose millions of dollars of funds on the sisters under obamacare in order to try to force the nuns to pay for abortioninducing drugs and others have a real simple rules litigating against probably done something on the first day and all i will instruct the department of justice and the irs and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty in today is the youngest fine gun control the same way we do in texas hidden what james and you know we are just a few weeks ago president obama issued executive back trying to undermine our individual right to keep and bear arms and need the very first thing i intend to do on the first day in office is rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by president obama we need to defend the fourth and fifth amendments our rights to primus how many of you let me ask you please leave your cell phones on i want to make sure president obama here is everywhere and we say today we need to defend the th or as president obama calls it the way the fundamental protection that says the powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states and to the people theres certain responsibilities of the federal government that they need to perform and perform well they need to keep this country say which means we need to rebuild the military and honor our solemn commitment to our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines it means we need to fundamentally reform the va so that every veteran choose his or her doctor and we need to finally finally finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities but there are other areas the federal government has no business sticking its nose and chief among those is education and we need to repeal every word reigniting the promise of america is we need to restore americas leadership for seven years weve seen america receding from leadership is made the world a much much more dangerous place we have abandoned an alienated our friends and allies and we have demonstrated weakness in appeasement to our enemies instead of a president who boycotts prime minister netanyahu imagine america standing unapologetically with the nation of israel we will have a command she stands up and says the world we will defeat radical islamic terrorists will have a president willing to utter the word radical islamic terrorism and we will we will completely destroy country is very simple the same thing is happening today people are waking up it took jimmy carter happens the republicans in america year old as an expresident is facially as a christian are you going to demonstrate that united states well thank you sir for that very good question you are absolutely right that their enormous income inequalities unjust and its wrong for a long time that i think the biggest line all the biggest lie at all politics is that republicans are the party of the rich the rich do just fine with big government business gets in bed with big government they have armies of lobbyists and lawyers accountants and the growing groaned when it comes to diagnosing the problem many folks in the press are often surprised when i say in large part i agree with bernie sanders i agree with bernie sanders at the fix is in that washington is corrupt that it is responding to the giant corporations in the special interests and the people getting the short end of the stick of the working men and women of this country this country is on the solution if government is corrupt bernie solution is we need more government backwards i have to say i cannot wait to stand on the debate stage with hillary clinton about income inequality the answer is the simple truth that income inequality has increased dramatically under the obama clinton policies of the last seven years the top one percent who are constantly being demagogued by the president the top higher share of income today than any year since the rich those who walk the corridors of power in the obama administration have gotten fat and happy you know six of the ten wealthiest counties in america in and around washington d c is a very profitable business but the people who have been hurt clinton economy an economy have been the most vulnerable its young people its its panics its africanamericans its single moms because when you hammer small businesses you take away jobs growth and the eu what you the people who lose those on the bottom rung of the economic ladder for me i think about every domestic policy from the perspective of my dad my dad was born and raised in cuba he was imprisoned and tortured as a teenager in cuba and my father came to america he was just a teeny at nothing in his underwear and he got a job washing dishes making fifty cents an hour i try to think of every issue impact my father if he were still washing dishes today for a second to understand the miracle of the american free enterprise system why did my dad start washing dishes well i couldnt speak english to speak english to take a dish put it under hot water and scrub he could do that in any language sometime my dad learned english pretty quickly so we got a second job is second job as a cook now that made cents an hour a better job than being a dishwasher he liked that better job is he got hired as a teaching assistant at the university of texas teaching undergraduate and then from there he got his next job at ibm as a computer programmer and then he went on to start a small business with my mom today my dad is a pastor he travels the country preach the gospel that is the journey up the economic ladder to the american dream that every one of us are families have travelled that is the american journey what you think about is my dad were still washing dishes today one of the reasons im so passionately opposed to obamacare the odds are very high he would have been fired or never hired because its those lowincome workers that are the ones getting hammered by obamacare because its now too expensive to keep on the payroll by some miracle he had managed to keep a job the odds are overwhelming is ours would have been forcibly reduced to hours a week obamacare kicks in hours a week and you cant feed your kids you cant pay your way through school on hours a week first job washing dishes you dont get the next job as a cook you dont get the next job as a teaching assistant at a computer programmer and not people off the bottom rung of the economic ladder you trapped them in dependency trap them out of being able to achieve the american dream so i think when it comes to income inequality republicans ought to be campaigning on it what i am campaigning for his all the way from getting the economic dream we can get back to the robust economic growth that enables anybody starting with nothing to achieve anything i think thats the core of our message and how we win yessir your competitors on the debate stage the other night seemed to have no problem with drafting our daughters into our daughters into the military and unfortunately you never got asked that question actually was not only against women he was ending selective service i was wondering whether he never did get around to i was wondering what your view was that thank you thank you very much for that question you know i have to admit that was one of the more surreal moments of the debate saturday night as we had three different yeah its a great idea to be dressed in our daughters to be dressing women into combat roles in the military i was not asked that question i was disappointed that almost jumped in and yesterday i dressed just say this i think my reaction that is are they nuts the father of two little girls who are five and seven carolina catherine can do anything they set their minds to anything their hearts and dreams desire unlimited potential but the idea that the federal government would script role pounds trying to kill them in a box home correctness run amok was standing there on that debate stage canada after another after another same sure we can do we should be drafting young girls in combat correctness time has come and assist police the truth planes and start actually teaching your kids and not just secretary there to limit the corruption and cronyism that is so corrupted working all capital expenditures if you buy a new plant or equipment is immediately expense depreciation tables no longer have the complexity of the irs code you need capital expenditures against current income that is a test for a job business led by senior going overseas business producing goods for export those entirely taxfree you dont pay no business flat tax on any of those the flip side is coming into america business flat tax of sixty percent of small businesses will have an enormous impact bringing jobs back to this country and whats amazing now to foreign countries your taxes on goods coming in we dont do the same fair and level playing field level playing field american productivity can beat anyone in the world so attack that marco rubio super pac is running and they put millions attack it is a blatantly deceptive attack and it is not truthful number one business flat tax is not a the sales tax you pay the cash register a business plan taxes not a sales tax on business revenue is imposed on the business not in the catholic church and the kids are constructed to suggest that this is somehow a tax increase and they know that this is reducing taxes in fact if you look at our white paper this simple flat point nine million capital investment percent of americans from the very from the least to the wealthiest would see doubledigit increase in after taxing so that i hear a single mom youre making forty thousand a year about real dollars in your pocket to provide for your kids and the attacks are trying to convince people that somehow cruise is raising taxes they know its false tax plan was designed by the architect of the reagan tax cuts that produced incredible incredible economic growth millions of new jobs and turn this country around we can do it again and thats the reason theyre trying to the treatment president this administration of the men and women of our armed services because we have a commanderinchief does not support the mission of the military does not have a clear mission to find doesnt stand behind them does not support them and even worse than that in the combat with rules of engagement whether arms are effectively tied behind their back whether unable to defend themselves sons and daughters to risk their lives politicians but youre not actually able to win you mentioned the restrictions the restrictions on service promises are we taking care of him following through on our obligations turn from their wicked ways then i will hear their prayers from heaven and will forgive their sinthank you thank you very much at work for the very very kind introduction and then and it has been so great spending time with with edna less and theyre theyre wonderful wonderful family its so great to be with so many dear friends here this morning id like to begin by just remembering those who were murdered in san bernardino yesterday i would ask if we could observe a moment of silence in their honor the details of what happened in san bernardino are still unclear what our prayers are with the families of those who were murdered of those who were shot and all of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism radical islamic terrorism here at home counting on the wake of the terror attack in paris this horrific murder underscores that we are at a time of war whether or not the current administration realizes it or is willing to acknowledge it our enemies are at war with us and i believe this nation needs a wartime president to defend it in recent weeks president obama traveled abroad to explain that he doesnt believe in american leadership that he doesnt believe in america winning quote i dont have time for that you know ive gotta say fdr and jfk and ronald reagan were spinning in their graves to hear an american president said he doesnt believe in american leadership for america winning ill tell you when it comes to radical islamic terrorism i think our strategy to borrow a page from ronald reagan in the cold war should be very simple we win they lose and their three things the next president should do to keep this nation safe the first is speak the truth ruth has power and at this point the politically correct double strict speak that comes from the obama administration has gone beyond the point of ridiculous when the president stands up and says the islamic state isnt islamic we need a president who the enemy by its name radical islamic terrorism and we will defeat it you know theres a power to speaking the truth back when israel was facing daily rocket fire with hamas i join with new york democrat kirsten gillibrand and introducing a resolution condemning hamas is use of human shields as a war crime that resolution passed both houses of congress unanimously as we came together to speak the truth likewise following the terrorist attack that occurred in florida hood over five years ago the obama administration refused to speak the truth refused to acknowledge that nadal his son who had communicated with anwar awlaki unknown radical cleric who had asked about the permissibility of waging jihad against his fellow servicemen who in walking through fort hood murdering innocent souls yelled out a little haha akbar as he committed that act of terrorism the obama administration inexplicably characterized that instead as workplace violence one of the things im most proud about my tenure in the senate is that i arduous the legislation to mandate that the purple heart awarded to those soldiers who were murdered the obama pentagon fought tooth and nail against that legislation yet im proud to say on the senate armed services committee i was able to earn the support of republicans and democrats we passed into law in december and in april i was at the ceremony where those purple hearts were awarded to each of the family members i simply shook their hands look them in the eyes and said im sorry im sorry it took five years to acknowledge the sacrifice of your loved one you know when it comes to speaking the truth this administration does precisely the opposite we have a president right now who at times operates as an apologist for radical islamic terrorists and i dont use that word lightly the word apologist has a very specific meeting this someone that gives a rationalization a justification for the conduct i was at the last national prayer breakfast youll recall the day before isis had lit a jordanian pilot on fire the king of jordan who is supposed to attend the prayer breakfast at the fly back to jordan and president obama gave a speech in which he said yes isis commits terrorist attack but so do christians and soda juice and he then invoked the crusades and the inquisition now the last i checked those ended about nine hundred years ago and i dont think its asking too much for the president of the united states to stay in the current millennia and the argument this is just like the crusades in the inquisition is exactly the argument that isis and the terrorists use and it is not beneficial nor is it beneficial when the secretary of state john kerry you know him well suggest some months ago that israel could become an apartheid state or when the secretary of state john kerry also says that the terrorist attack against charlie hebdo was understandable the united states of america should not be trying to rationalize radical islamic terrorists ill tell you when john kerry was nominated only three senators voted against his confirmation never have been prouder to be in that gang of three and when kerry called israel an apartheid state i went to the senate floor and called for kerrys resignation and when he and i would note that we need more senators both republicans and democrats that likewise call for accountability when the secretary of state uses language that undermines the safety and security of our allies and thats the second thing we need to do is we need to stand by our allies early in the obama administration there were warning signs one in the opening weeks the president sent back to the united kingdom the bust of winston church that was just a foreshadowing of things to come in after seven years we have not seen it administration more antagonistic in hostile to the nation of israel in the entire history of this country if i have suggested to you six years ago that the elected prime minister of israel would come to america would address a joint session of congress and he would be boycotted by the president of the united states the vice president of the united states and every member of the cabinet our friends in the media would have dismissed that is crazy conspiracy to that would never happen ill tell you on the eve of that speech i organized a panel discussion with elie wiesel to discuss the threat of the iranian nuclear deal le was wanted that to be a bipartisan discussion so i invited one democrat after another democrat after another democrat after another democrat we invited roughly a dozen democrats and not a single democrat was willing to stand on a stage with elie wiesel and discuss the iranian nuclear i will tell you it was truly humbling and powerful just to be on that stage with a man who has seen the face of evil and can speak truth with a moral gravity that when ally was el said as he did that never again must mean never again in the one threat of that happening is a nuclear iran we need a president who will stand unapologetically with the nation of israel when hamas murdered three israeli teenagers i join with new jersey democrat bob menendez to introduce legislation providing a five million dollar reward for information leading to the capture of the terrorists who had kidnapped and murdered neftali frankel one of the three tally was a dual israeli us citizen that legislation passed the senate unanimously thankfully they captured the terrorists before the house to take it up just in the past couple of weeks ive put together a bipartisan coalition of some senators to write to the eu to oppose their plan to require labeling on products coming out of israel pledged that if im elected president on the very first day in office we will begin the process of moving the american embassy to jerusalem the one senator dole capitalism and let me tell you now as we see the global bds movement unfortunately getting more and more momentum behind it a cruise administration any university that supports the bds movement will find its federal funds stripped away and the third thing we need is we need to defeat our enemies not to weaken them not to degrade them but to defeat them two years ago the nation of iran named as their ambassador to the united nations amida buddha lobby a known terrorist who participated nolan holding americans hostage everyone in this town wrung their hands they said this is terrible theres nothing we can do i introduce legislation barring a buddha lobby and other known terrorists from coming to america it passed the senate nothing it passed the house the four hundred and thirtyfive to nothing and president obama signed into law our enemies as understanding and that means not going down the misguided foreign policy barack obama and hillary clinton and unfortunately too many republicans in this town in hillary clinton and barack obama led the effort to topple the government in libya the consequence of that libyas been handed over to radical islamic terrorists fighting in a war zone shortly thereafter the obama administration led the effort to topple mubarak in egypt the consequence of that the muslim brotherhood a terrorist organization became the government in egypt and now we see the obama administration with the support of politicians in both parties trying to topple the government in syria with no plan for what will replace it if we are to defeat our enemies we need to be cleareyed at toppling the government and allowing radical islamic terrorists to take over a nation is not benefiting our national security interests putting my sister alqaida or the muslim brotherhood in charge of yet another state in the middle east is not benefiting our national security instead we need a president who focuses clearly and says we will utterly destroy ice makes abundantly clear to any militant on the face of the earth if you go enjoy nice if you wage jihad against the united states of america you are signing youre just words and then finally we have the iranian nuclear deal if im elected president i have pledged in the very first day in office to rip to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal republican debates there have been other republican candidates for president who said gosh thats not a very sophisticated approach you dont understand we need to wait and see if we can trust the iranians they tell you what i do trust the iranians when the ayatollah khomeini burns american and israeli flags and says death to america i trusted that he means it and i believe in peace through strength we are facing a moment like munich in and president obama like chamberlain his comeback from tehran promising peace in our time yet history has not been kind to those who have facilitated the gathering storm of homicidal maniacs who tell us they want to kill us the next president needs to have the fortitude to say to the ayatollah khamenei in no uncertain terms either you will stop your nuclear weapons program or we will stop it for you and i have said many times this election this moment in time is eerily similar to the late nineteen seventies the parallels between barack obama and jimmy carter are uncanny same failed economic policies the same misery stagnation and malaise the same feckless and naive foreign policy in fact the exact same countries russia and iran openly laughing and mocking the present united states i believe this next election is going to be an election like that we are going to win by painting and bold colors and not pale pastels manifest failures of the carter administration set the stage for the reagan revolution which came from millions of americans across this country it was a grassroots movement it didnt come from washington washington despised it came from the american people in it transformed this country and the world of optimism i will give you is the same thing is happening all over this country people are waking up incredibly and when it comes to foreign policy the difference a strong president can make is underscored by the simple fact that this very same nation the nation of iran released our hostages the day ronald reagan was sworn in happy to answer or dodge any questions first of all senator thank you on behalf of the republican jewish coalition im never got a standing ovation before i got a couple questions we have been collecting questions over the last couple weeks and curated a bunch of them and i know you touching a bunch of your remarks but one of the things that comes up in my apologies in advance for this comparison but a number of people have asked that much has been made of barack obama coming into office as a firstterm senator with no foreign policy experience how do you respond to those who raised the same concerns about you well i say two things when the media ask josh arent you like barack obama my reaction to reporters as i thought you thought that was a good thing presidential elections and listen barack obama is not a bad president because he was a senator barack obamas a bad president has an unmitigated socialists who wont stand up and defend the united states of america theres a broader point in this if you look at the last years and at the two moments that had the greatest impact on human liberty i would suggest it was in nineteen eighty the election of ronald reagan and in the election of barack obama the first in a very positive way the second in a very negative way now they both share something in common both reagan and obama believed profoundly and their principles they had the courage to fight for them when barack obama said he wanted to fundamentally transform this country he meant it and the damage that has been done in the last seven years is enormous and i believe the only way to undo the damage is as republicans we need to nominate a candidate for president is committed to conservative principles as barack obama is too liberal arts this dovetails into the the next question which is how would you convince staunchly prochoice voters who love your views on security on israel that they can still be prochoice and vote for your well you know thats a question that comes up a lot in the end the simple reality is to win every one of us wants to win at this point desperately and its not just a question of our team winning its a question of saving this country i believe the stakes have never been higher than they are right now that we are at the edge of a precipice were bankrupting our kids and grandkids the safety and security of this country is hanging in the balance and if we continue another for eight more years down this road we will lose this country so we should all with a stone cold seriousness at how we win now in washington there are political consultants who tell us over and over and over again the way you win if youre under the middle and this is no longer an abstract theory we have now beta tested this theory and every time we follow that advice we get clobbered it doesnt work in the reason it doesnt work is very simple if you compare the last race we won nationally to and the biggest difference is the millions upon millions of conservative voters who showed up and ill for who stayed home and away and stayed home in bigger numbers and and i believe if were going to win the central question in this general election is how do you motivate and inspire and bring back to the polls to million evangelical christians who stayed home in how do you motivate and bring back to the polls the reagan democrats the bluecollar catholics across the midwest and up into new england who stayed home in the polls and the one thing that is abundantly clear as if we nominate another candidate in the mold of a bob dole or a john mccain or mitt romney all of whom are good honorable decent men who love this country what take did didnt work and if we do it again the same millions of voters who stayed home in and will stay home and and hillary becomes the next press so how do we win if you look since war workers since world war two the only republicans who have ever won have run on all three legs of the conservative school they have run as fiscal conservatives social conservatives and national security conservatives if you chop off one of those legs we dont get to and so the trick is to speak in a way that energizes so for example you asked about the question of life ill tell you the context in which i most like to discuss life and that is the little sisters of the poor the little sisters of the poor a catholic charity of nuns whove taken vows of poverty they spend their lives caring for the poor and elderly and right now the obama administration is litigating against the little sisters of the poor trying to force the nuns to pay for abortioninducing drugs and ive jokes many times a really good rule of thumb if youre litigating against guns probably done something wrong values that bring us together bringing back jobs and growth and opportunity defending our constitutional rights and restoring americas leadership in the world that in nineteen eighty is how the reagan revolution rose up its what brought millions of people to the polls who had never voted again and its what were seeing happening now there is a reason why and six months weve had over contributions and ted cruz double our average contribution is there is a reason why we do rallies couple a couple of weeks ago were in kalamazoo michigan am on a monday morning in a hockey rink people came out almost all reagan democrats irish catholic union members working men and women the people getting hammered by the obama economy if were going to win we run a populist campaign of hard working men and women who want to believe again in the promise of america and we run it against the bipartisan corruption of washington that hillary clinton and bodies and let me say one final thing that i cannot wait to stand on a debate stage with hillary clinton win elections by making choices that are meaningful choices you dont blur the difference theres a reason theres only one republican in the last years as a group of democrats named after reagan democrats winning to nominate a candidate who has the clarity to stand up and say if you vote for hillary clinton you were voting for the ayatollah khomeini to have nuclear weapons and if you vote for me iran will never have nuclear weapons if you vote for hillary clinton you are voting for million people who are here illegally to be granted amnesty if you vote for me we will secure the border and stop illegal immigration if you vote for hillary you are voting for obama care to be a permanent feature of our economy in perpetuity if you vote for me we will repeal every word of obamacare that i believe is how we win with a cheerful clear meaningful distinction that makes it dif to working men and women across this country thank you senatorthank you for your strong conservative principled stance in the legislature and thank you for your work along with our incredible michigan team along with saul anuzis and windy day and so many tremendous conservatives across this state who are leading our effort i am thrilled to be with each of you today how many of you watch the debate in california is it to have such a tremendous array of talent on that stage charismatic talented young leader stepping forward to be leaders in the republican party and leaders in the nation and what a contrast with the democrats you know im pretty sure the first democratic debate is going to consist of hillary clinton and the chipotle clerk well now now now actually thats not fair thats not fair we cant forget about bernie sanders so now the democratic field consists of a wildeyed socialist with ideas that are dangerous for america and the world and bernie sanders and you know its really quite amazing watching the democrats delay their debates at first it was gonna be september than october than november you know i think they may end up just moving the debate till its actually its not widely known but the democrats had actually planned to have an earlier debate the problem was the debate invitation was emailed hillary you know were here today because our nation is in crisis were here today because were bankrupting our kids and grandkids because our constitutional rights are under assault from washington like never before and because america has receded from leadership in the world and it has made the world a much more dangerous place and yet im here with a word of hope and encouragement an exhortation all across the state of michigan all across this country people are waking up we are seeing an awakening sweeping this country and let me tell you right now help is on the way so i wanna ask everyone here to look forward look forward to january if im elected president let me tell you what i intend to do on my first day in office the first thing i intended to is rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by this press president obama likes to say hes got a phone and hes got a pin where you live by the pan you die by the pen and my pen has got an eraser but sadly the corruption has not just been limited to the white house it has pervaded every branch of the federal government and this is the most partisan and lawless department of justice we have ever seen the second thing i intended to on the first day in office isnt struck the uss department of justice to open an investigation into planned parenthood and these horrible videos the administration of justice should be blind to party or ideology the only fidelity at the department of justice should be to the laws and the constitution of the united states of america the third thing i intend to do on the first day in office isnt struck the department of justice and the irs and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty and today that means that every serviceman and woman has the right to worship god with all of his heart mind and soul and his commanding officer has nothing to say about and that means the little sisters of the poor a catholic charity that the obama administration is litigating against trying to impose millions of dollars of funds under obamacare on the sisters in order to try to force the nuns to pay for abortioninducing drugs and others now let me give you all a real simple rule of thumb if youre litigating against guns youve probably done something wrong in january the little sisters of the poor will discover that the case against them has been dismissed the forest thing i intend to do on the first day in office is ripped to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal single greatest national security threat facing americas the threat of a nuclear iran you know about a month ago i observed if this deal goes through the obama administration will become quite literally the leading financier of radical islamic terrorism in the world now in response to that president obama got very upset and i do so hate to dismay that he interrupted his busy world travels in between the eighth and ninth holes to attack me directly he said what cruz said is ridiculous you cant say that you cannot use that rhetoric but let me give you a very very simple principle truth is not rhetoric and in the entire course of his attack it actually bother to try to refute any of the substance of what i said so lets review the facts back number one iran is today the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism back number two if this deal goes through over billion dollars will flow directly to iran directly to the ayatollah khomeini and fax number three if that happens billions of those dollars will go to fund hamas and hezbollah and the who teased and jihadists across the globe who will use those billions to murder americans to murder israelis and murder europeans if president obama doesnt like the rhetoric of his administration becoming the worlds leading financier of radical islamic terrorism there is an easy solution stop financing radical islamic terrorists thing i intend to do on the first day in office is begin the process of moving the american embassy in israel to jerusalem the one senator no capital of israel now you know a lot of presidential candidates both republicans and democrats had made that exact same promise and yet inevitably when they get to the white house they dont do it and what happens is their team comes to them and says you know if we do that thatll make other folks in the middle east really really unhappy with you hadnt noticed there are already pretty unhappy with and ill tell you the single biggest difference between me and the other fine men and women standing on that debate stake is that with me when i tell you im gonna do something im gonna do exactly what i said i would thats day one there are days in a year for years in a presidential term and four years in a second term by the end of eight years theyre gonna be a whole lot of newspaper reporters and editors and journalists whove check themselves into therapy in the days that follow i will go to congress and we will repeal every word of obamacare in its place will pass commonsense health care reform that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable and keeps the government from getting in between us and our doctors in the days that follow i will instruct the us department of education which should be abolished i will instruct the us department of education that common core and study day and the days that follow we will rebuild the military we will honor our commitments made every soldier and sailor and airman and marine and we will protect the right to keep and bear arms of every serviceman and woman that means the next time a jihadist walks into a recruiting station in chattanooga hes going to encounter the business end of firearms wielded by a dozen marines in the days that follow we will finally finally finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities we will stop the obama administrations indefensible practice of releasing violent criminal illegal aliens and we will pass case law in the days that follow we will take on the epa and the cfpb and the alphabet soup of federal agencies that have defended like locusts on small businesses and we will unleash booming economic growth that will lift people up millions of people coming out of school will get jobs and move back on a path to the american jury and in the days that follow i will go to congress and we will pass fundamental tax reform we will pass a simple flat tax so that every american can fill out his or her taxes on a postcard and when we do that we should abolish the irs there about employees at the irs we need to padlock that building take all ninety thousand put him down on our southern border now to our friends in the median i say that somewhat tongueincheek but yeah if you think about it ron if you imagine imagine you traveled thousands of miles in the blazing sun youre swimming across the rio grant and the first thing you see is irs agents you turn around and go thinking all of that make sense its simple commonsense live within your means dont bankrupt our kids and grandkids follow the constitution but can it be done can we do it you know scripture tells us is nothing new under the sun i think where we are today is very very much like the late nineteen seventies the parallels are uncanny the same failed economic policies leading to the same misery stagnation and malaise the same back listen naive foreign policy in fact the exact same countries russia and iran openly laughing and mocking the president of the united states now why is it that that analogy gives me so much hope and optimism because we know how that story and all across this country millions of men and women rose up and became the reagan revolution and it didnt come from washington washington despised ronald reagan by the way if you see a candidate who washington embraces run and hide it came from the american people in it turn this country around we went from stagnation in misery to booming growth millions lifted out of poverty into prosperity and the american dream we went from our hostages languishing in iran to winning the cold war and tearing the berlin wall to the ground optimistic because the same thing is happening again all over the country the same thing is happening again people are waking up you know we launched our campaign on march rd at liberty university the new york times promptly opined crews cannot win because the washington elites despise him i kinda thought that was the whole point of the campaign lesson if you think things are going great washington if you think we need to continue heading in the same basic directions just kind of fiddle around the edges then i your guy on the other hand if you think washington is fundamentally broken that there is a bipartisan corruption of career politicians in both parties who get in bed with lobbyists and special interests and grow and grow and grow government if you think we need to take power out of washington and back to we the people that is what this campaign is all about so the times continued they said okay maybe the grass roots will be with groups but he gonna have any money because those washington elites control all the money and all the lobbyists are with other candidates who arent gonna rock the boat were gonna keep that gravy train flowing well over a month ago all of the campaigns filed their fundraising reports at a seventeen republican candidates do you know which campaign raised the most hard money we did in just over three months our campaign raised over fourteen point three million dollars second place was jeb bush with now if i told you up at six months ago that we were gonna out raise every candidate in the field including out raising jeb bush by three million dollars you said i was bark at the moon crazy by the way someone suggested that for a bumper sticker for us you know how he did that that came from over a hundred and seventyfive thousand contributions in all states people all over the country going to ted cruz or ted cruz dot org ted cruz dot org crews dot org our average contribution was that is the power of the grass roots and let me tell you an interesting thing about momentum after the first debate in cleveland in the hundred hours that followed that debate our campaign raised over one million dollars and we just had another debate in california we announced this morning that it didnt take us our campaign in the first hours after the debate raised again another million dollars let me close with this for everyone here freedom is not some abstract concept we read about the school book freedom is real its personal in our lives its our families you know for me i think about my mom my mom is irish italian born in wilmington delaware bluecollar family her mom was the second youngest of kids they were irish didnt know what else to do on a saturday night my mom became the first person in her family ever to go to college now my grandfather my mothers dad was a difficult man he was drunk and he didnt think women should be educated and he certainly didnt think his daughter should be the first person in the family to go to college while my mom ended up going to rice university graduating with a degree in math in she went to work at shell as a computer programmer now you wanna talk about two industries the oil and gas industry and computer science neither one of which were very welcoming to women my mom was at the intersection of both teams to tell me that shes very deliberately didnt learn how to type she said look it was the nineteen fifties i understood the world i was living it she said i dont wanna be walking down the hall and have a woman walk up and have a man walked up to me and say sweetheart would you type this for me my mom wanted to be able to smile very very sweetly and with a clean conscience say i would love to help ya but i dont know how to type i guess youre gonna have to use me as a computer programmer instead my mom is a woman of incredible courage and conviction shes been a best friend to me my whole life she is an amazing grandmother to our two little girls carolina catherine and then i think about my dad rafael cruz my father was born in cuba he grew up in cuba and as a teenager my dad begin fighting in the cuban revolution fighting when he was years old he was thrown in prison when he was and he was tortured by batistas army but my dad was lying in that cuban jail covered in blood and blood and mud and grime his nose broken his teeth dangling from his mouth he told me he remember thinking i dont have any kids no family depends on me it doesnt matter if i live or die but thankfully god had different plans for my father my father escape cuba came to america in when it came to this country was years old he couldnt speak a word of english at sewn into his underwear his first job was washing dishes make it fifty cents an hour and he worked seven days a week he paid his way through school and my dad and my mom when i ended up forming a small business together today my dad is a pastor he travels the country preaching the gospel my whole life my dad has been my hero but you know what i find most incredible about his story and place it is every one of us here weve got a story just like that some of us its us others its our parents others its our great great great grand but what ties americans together is we are all the children of those who risked everything for freedom when i was a kid my dad used to say to me over and over again when we faced repression in cuba i had a place to flee to if we lose our freedom here where do we go that is why all of us are here today were here today because we will not go quietly into the night we will not give up on our children and grandchildren we will stand and fight for freedom we will stand and fight for the constitution and if we the people rise up together we will bring back and restore that last best hope for mankind that shining city on a hill that is the united statesgod bless the great state of south carolina know how many of yall watch the debate this week how fantastic is it that we have so many young talented dynamic republican candidates running for president and what a contrast with the democrats you know im pretty sure the first democratic debate consisted of hillary and the chipotle clerk we cant forget about bernie cent so now the democratic field consists of a wildeyed socialist whose ideas are dangerous for american the world and centers and is anyone else noticed that they keep scheduling the democratic debates at like in the morning on a saturday they aired on alaska pbs you know its almost like they dont want anyone to see their candidates but there is good news they have announced the location of the next democratic debate theyre gonna hosted at leavenworth and wanted to make it easier for hillary to attend you know im so glad to be back with all of you want to start by just giving thanks for news we got today at four americans are coming home from iran or americans including pastor saeed abedini so many of us have been lifting up pastor saeed and our prayers you know ive gotten to know his wife nominee who is a wonderful wonderful person who has stood like iraq pastor saeed was wrongly imprisoned whos raised their two little kids in idaho while her husband languished in an iranian prison so we give thanks to god that theyre coming home but at the same time weve gotta shake there are headed howard said you know the details of this dealer still coming in you notice that the obama administration announces the good news and then hides the bad news so the details that are still coming out but from what we understand were releasing seven people who were incarcerated for violating the sanctions on iran and helping iran develop nuclear weapons and their another dozen or more who violated the law that weve agreed were just not gonna prosecute and let me say there is a false moral equivalence in a deal like this saeed was in prison for the crime of preaching the gospel he shouldnt have been there amir hekmati aus marine shouldnt have been there in that prison jason resin a reporter who was in prison for reporting on the news shouldnt have been there and so will we celebrate their return this deal serves as a piece of propaganda for both the rain in the obama administration you noticed every compliant reporter will say listen this iranian deal wonderful me tell you three years ago i introduced legislation and said the unconditional release of american hostages should be the first step in the precondition before beginning any conversation with iran we saw this past week when iran captured two ships in prison sailors tried to humiliate them president obama and john kerry celebrate how wonderful after humiliating our sailors they let him go no it is not wonderful they should have been captured in the first place and i will tell you that image braves sailors forced to their knees that image will summarize the failures of the obama clinton foreign policy more powerful than any image from the last seven years and so many people here have been burned by politicians have had the experience and we have a politician they come up they campaign and they say they say everything we want here and we vote for him and go to washington and they dont do what they said and let me say that hadnt happened once had happened twice it happens over and over and over again and lessen the stakes in never been higher our country is hanging in the balance get a very simple question for the folks here how do we not get burned again and i wasnt fishing for that there is no more important question in this primary then how do we not get burned again because you know what every single republican running knows what youre supposed to say did you notice that nobody on thats debate stage gets up and says ima squishy establishment moderate i stand for nothing none of them say that when someone announces his republican candidate for president suddenly they agree with the values of everyone in this room and let me suggest a simple rule ignore what all of us ignore what i say ignore what every other candidate says dont listen to the words on the campaign trail looked action i had a former boss he used to say if im ever accused of being a christian id like to be enough evidence to convict me being a conservative if youre really a conservative youre really a constitutionalist you shouldnt have to tell anybody because you will bear the scars you will have been in the foxholes in the fight you will have been standing for your principles and it will be evident for everyone to see if you agree with me that the stakes have never been higher and i want to suggest a metric to apply to every candidate this is a time for choosing and im going to highlight seven times for choosing battles in recent years where every candidate for public office had a choice of where to stay lets start with the fight over obamacare in millions of americans rose up against the disaster that was obama obamacare was getting ready to be implemented in you know what republican leadership decided they didnt wanna fight they were scared to fighting they didnt want to stand up and fight when millions of americans rose up i was proud to stand alongside millions of americans fighting to stop obamacare journalists today wrote a column saying cruise doesnt talk about the shutdown anymore if you recall washingtondc was terrified to fight the because millions of us stood up together and lit up the phone for one brief moment we saw him to the backbone appearing in all of us were taught in junior high that in vertebrates cant walk upright and yet politicians disprove that every single day and let me suggest that time for choosing if you wanna know by the way every republican candidate for president says theyll repeal obamacare will also offer to sell you a bridge you want to know whos really going to repeal obamacare you want to know whos willing the bleedin stand in asked if every candidate on that stage where were you when the fight was being fought and the american people were standing up to washington if if you didnt stand up if you did engage lets look at a second time for choosing fight over guns following the horrific shooting in newtown connecticut president obama and chuck schumer came out with an aggressive new national gun control plan the president could have tried to unify as he could have brought us together and say lets focused on violent criminals lets come after violent criminals come down on them like a ton of bricks that would have brought us together that would have been the right thing to do to stop the murderers and rapists and criminals president obama didnt do that instead he pursued a partisan agenda try to take away the right to keep and bear arms of millions of lawabiding americans in response to that millions of us across the country rose up to defend our constitutional rights i was proud to stand and lead that fights enter the utter astonishment to the shock and dismay of barack obama and harry reid chuck schumer who were triumphant when it came time to a vote every single one of their proposals undermined the second amendment right to keep and bear arms was voted down on the senate floor now once again any republican presidential race every republican candidate will stand up on that stage and say they support the second amendment there are no dumb dumbs on that stage there is a simple test to apply to distinguish campaign rhetoric from an actual record in when barack obama and chuck schumer and harry reid were trying to take away our nd amendment right to keep and bear arms where work did you stand up and fight for you otherwise engaged if you wanna know where someone is look to their acts lets take a third exam and nasty now in this election and a lot of folks who want to talk about immigration wanna talk about securing the borders i think thats fabulous i think thats fabulous that people are finally focused on the reality that border security is national security but we had a battle in led by barack obama and chuck schumer and far too many establishment republicans in washington and then on the other side millions of americans rose up and said no we dont want amnesty we want to secure our borders and protect the american people and we had incredible heroes in warriors leading that battle people like jeff sessions and steve king who stood heroically with the american people and i was proud to be shouldertoshoulder with jeff sessions and steve king leading the fight and when it came time for the votes remember by the way they push it through the senate and republican leadership plan to jam it through the house it was about to pass it was going to happen the issue is lost all of the reporters were listening to the democrats crow triumph a republican leadership would join with all the democrats to pass amnesty obama would sign it and the battle would be if any candidate for president says he or she really cares about immigration when were on the verge of losing the major battle with the fight will be over if this bill is signed into law and its no longer question of talking its a choice of where and i will say this anybody who was awol from the battle on the gang of eight has no standing as a candidate now to say they will enforce the border your actions speak louder than words and they give a fourth issue a set of issues that gave rise to the birth of the tea party the combination of tarp the stimulus and cronyism in washington corporate welfare that is what i meant to this incredible grassroots movement of the tea party fed up with bailing out wall street and ignoring main street in the working men and women of this country my time in the senate i have been proud to stand over and over and over again with the american people fighting against cronyism fighting against the mandates fighting against bailouts no bailouts for any bank period no subsidies no mandates stop picking winners and losers and let me say if someone tells you theyre tea party you cant beat tea party and at the same time have supported you cant be tea party and at the same time have supported barack obamas stimulus you cant be cheap party and at the same time support the ethanol mandate cos its good politics in iowa and support the sugar subsidies cuz its good politics in florida and support all of the other corporate welfare and cronyism so if you really want to know what kind of president is someone gonna be are they gonna take on the washington cartel it gonna take on the lobbyists you can ask yourself the simple question where do they stand on tarpon stimulus and cronyism and corporate welfare and if they werent willing to take it on the fights were being thought i can tell you no one in history ever grew a backbone after they got to pennsylvania avenue let me give you a fifth time for choosy and its marriage and religious liberty last year the supreme court five unelected judges issued a lawless fundamentally illegitimate decision reporting to tear down the marriage laws of all fifty states when that decision came down there was a time for choosing for every where do you stand which side of the line are you on by the way our friends in the media they want us to give up on this flight although they celebrate your enlightened wisdom to allow inst marriage the foundation of the family from millennia from the very beginning from a nominee to celebrate tearing down marriage the media praises you when youre selling lightness to want to tear down the fundamental building blocks of the family and society that decision provided every candidate with a choice and ill tell you quite a few of the candidates stand on that debate stage stood up and said the supreme courts decision is the settled law of the land we need to accept it surrender and move on now those are wordforword barack obamas talking any republican who responded to that decision by saying its the settled law of the land move on we know for a fact as president they will not defend marriage theyve told us that do not be surprised how do you not get burned again dont listen to the words listen to what theyve done if theyve surrendered the fight on marriage at the outset they aint gonna be there in the future and when it comes to the assault on religious liberty our first liberty the very first right protected in the first amendment of the bill of rights you wanna know if someone will stand with pastors someone will stand with rabbis someone will stand with priests someone will stand with you and me and protect our fundamental right to seek out and worship god almighty with all of our hearts minds and souls then dont listen to their words on the campaign trail asked when if you stood and fought religiously talks cheap its easy to say it when hit you stood and fought to defend the ten commandments to defend the pledge of allegiance to defend veterans memorials that honor the men and women who gave their lives for this country when the government comes and subpoenas pastors as they did in my home city of houston he just stand with the pastors fight the sixth time for choosing that matters is the battle over planned parenthood remember the debate at the reagan library or just about every candidate looked in the tv camera and gave an emotional speech about how important it was to stop playin parent in light of these horrific videos in which theyre caught on tape essentially admitting to a pattern of felonies illegally selling the body parts of unborn children every candidate just about said gosh this is terrible just a few weeks later we had a knockdown dragout fight in washingtondc exactly this issue millions of americans rose up i i was part of reaching out to a over a hundred thousand protesters nationwide asking the pastor to pray for this country to light up the phone and call their members of congress i was proud to stand with millions of americans saying enough is enough on planned parenthood and let me say something of the other very fun individuals on that debate stage none of them were anywhere to be found that was a moment can you imagine how different that fight would have been if every major presidential candidate had descended on washington d c had stood in unison said mitch mcconnell and john boehner dont send five hundred million dollars of taxpayer funding to planned parenthood and there are candidates on that stage that right now today say we should continue to send taxpayer funds to planned parenthood nobody should be surprised if you get burned if youre not willing to stand up when the fight is happening youre not going to do anything different if you ever get elected and by the way anyone who says the marriage decision is the settled all the land anyone who is afraid to stand up the planned parenthood ill tell you right now every supreme court justice they name will be a disaster are you fed up with republicans nominating liberals to the supreme court where youve got direct power of that which is dont support anyone whos run away from the fight on life and marriage because if youre not willing to stand and fight on life and marriage every judge you put on the court is going to be a disaster why because youre going to curry favor with the new york times instead of standing with the american people and let me give you the seventh and final time for choosing and its the battle over i ran the single greatest national security threat facing around facing this country is the threat of a nuclear and we saw this week just how profoundly dangerous it is after iran captures our ships after they attempt to humiliate our sailors what is barack obama do turns around and wants to give the ayatollah khomeini a hundred and fifty billion dollars i got an idea how about we sell our ships billion apiece this is shameful it is wrong i tell you this if im elected president our sailors will never be on their knees a report that we heard black helicopters any islamic terror terrorist any islamic tyrants who attempts to capture us servicemen and women will face the full force and fury of the united states of america we will not bargain with terrorists we will not negotiate with terrorists we will not as barack obama does apologize for terrorists instead if you are a radical islamic militants and i would note they are radical islamic militants last i checked it wasnt a bunch of presbyterians who flew the planes into the twin towers if you are a militant anywhere on the face of the planet and you go enjoy nice as you go and wage jihad against the united states of america and attempt to murder americans you are signing your death weve had a moment where this battle is being fought on iran asks of the candidates running who is stepped forward to lead stopping this iranian deal who is step forward to delve into the details to understand whats going on to understand what we need to do to prevent the ayatollah khomeini from ever getting a nuclear weapon if that fight is not important for someone to step forward in lead what fight will be me tell you if im elected president on the very first day i pledge to do things number one receiver and every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action number to instruct the us department of justice to open an investigation into planned parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations number three and struck the department of justice and the irs and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today number for ripped to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal and number five begin the process of moving the american embassy in israel to jerusalem the once an internal capital of israel for every one of us that agrees stakes have never been higher and for every one of us that raised her hands and said weve been burned before by politicians who made promises and havent done it how can you know that i will follow through on those promises on the first day in office and every day afterwards as the scripture has said you shall know them by their fruits in any candidate on that stage a matter how much you might like them when theyre campaigning if they havent stood and fought at those seven times for choosing if they havent been willing to stand and lead you can know to an absolute fact they wouldnt do so as president ive if we want to see another john boehner in the white house and we shouldnt look to peoples records we should listen to what they say but if we cant get burned again we should ignore all the campaign rhetoric from everyone and simply say whos been walking look whos demonstrated through action where they stand i wanna give you one final word of encouraged ive said many many times i think today is very very much like the parallels between barack obama and jimmy carter are on it took jimmy carter to give us ronald reagan and im convinced the most long lasting legacy of barack obamas gonna be a new generation of leaders in the republican party that stands for the constitution that stand for freedom and that stand with the people thank you and god bless youthey say first of all my good friend jeff sessions thank you for the very very kind introduction and i want to say to the men and women of alabama for sending this principled conservative patriot who shouldertoshoulder with fight after fight after fight where all the money all the power in washington was arraigned on one side and a handful of conservatism or stand with the working men and women of this country on the other side and ill tell you when youre standing with the people you want to win and side table of alabama washingtondc so it can america tuesday why we have such a dynamic talented candidates for presidenthours theyll move on to an investor will see millions of dollars in attack ads but all that time has past this is now the time for the men and women in this room this is the time to make a decision a decision that frankly the whole country is looking to you and counting on you to make everyone here has not ever get the chance and that he is a candidate and make a determination telling the truth how many people here then burned over and over again she campaigned for the service people come out a coffee break a leg we see it over and over know every day ago times online foundational principle is a ride along with everything else feel that every goal in life is a precious gift from god case the appeal the court of appeal and we want to plan now to life matters what is your rap over years of his life support it partialbirth abortion we should not be surprised his marriage and religious absolutely lawless judges do create the power is now a bad time to decide where candidates in this race day supreme courts decision is settled law of the land we surrender we accept it google were republican presidential candidate read the exact same talking points owner to stand and fight for marriage for decades crowds legal and constitutional chief says never let me go away and he didnt hard drives a law and said let the second amended a wonderful day but that he was still runs this is a fundamental protection he got it right because everyone of us has the right if anyone comes into our own seeks to harm our family harm our children is a fundamental right was voted down no history discoveries and any iranian nuclear dealings hand place comply and maybe go to believe that does not understand the nature of the ayatollah khamenei share data to america for an american flag somebody tells you they want to kill you believe elected president to shred terrain determination that is who is best prepared to be a man who has the experience and knowledge understanding with clarity of vision strength and resolve to identify alleged president we will not be greatly will weaken we will completely destroyed all right now where they dont listen to the campaign rhetoric instead local turnarounds and which because he tells me but because hes been doing it over and over and over braces and that i tell ya so happened at home town meeting was watching and she said it she said when his daughter was more now because it wa gwan

for the very very kind introduction it is great to be with so many friends here today you know man was driving along a country road and he spots a little boy on the side of the road with a box of kittens and a sign that says free kittens theyre democrats man thinks that kinda strange keeps on driving few days later is coming along the same country road sees the same little boy same box of kittens but this time a sign that says free kittens there republicans a man thinks thats the strangest thing ive ever seen he pulls up on the side of the road he comes up to me says son i dont understand i drove by here a few days ago you said these kids were democrats now theyre republicans little boy looks at amigos will mister how their eyes are open and let me tell you in recent weeks we have seen over and over again how the left has their eyes close to the realities the dangers of this world and ill tell you what freedomworks is doing everyday what is happening all across this country is people are waking up and theyre open up their eyes and theyre saying this doesnt make any sense i wanna talk to you today about liberty and security in an age of terror you know for seven years we have seen both liberty and security going away and the obama administration there many in the media that tell us theres a tradeoff you can either have liberty or security will endure president obama we get neither under president obama the federal government is targeting the liberty of individual lawabiding citizens and at the same time its not standing up to our enemies and what the obama administration gets wrong as it has a hard time distinguishing between good guys and bad the obama administrations approach is to go after the constitutional rights of lawabiding citizens and at the same time fail to go after the terrorists let me tell you our liberties are a critical part of why we are safe we are secure because we can speak out and because we are armed today peggy noonan has a fantastic column in the wall street journal calling on people to speak out for the first amendment calling against liberals who have assaulted the first amendment the democrats in the senate last year introduced a constitutional amendment to repeal the free speech protections of the first amendment you know weve seen the neighbors of the san bernardino terrorists who said i suspected something i thought something was wrong when i didnt want to say it because it wasnt politically correct we see on college campuses and universities the speech police telling people you cant speak unless it is sanitized let me tell you something if this administration funds the nation of iran getting a nuclear weapon and they set off a mushroom cloud thats a pretty big micro aggression we see loretta lynch the attorney general promising in the wake of this terrorist attack that she come out and say were going to track down the terrorists and killed them know she says the department of justice will prosecute anyone that has the temerity to stand up and speak against radical islamic terrorism and let me tell you right now radical islamic terrorism is evil mister president there is not a moral equivalence between radical islamic terrorists and christians and jews and up from day one of murdering whose those who they consider infidels the other preach love and forgiveness and standing together as one humanity and let me say beyond that in the united states we will not enforce sharia law attorney general if you want to come for executing my first amendment rights come and get me im right here and then we look at religious liberty in the wake of the attack in san bernardino i and many other leaders expressed our prayers for the families of those who emerged of those who were wounded new york daily news ran a frontpage story repeating my tweet now set aside for a second its a little surreal to see your tweets on the front page of a newspaper i guess that is the definition of a slow news day but repeating my queen and those of others and the news on the cover of the new york daily news is we dont need your prayers theyve invented a new term for that they call it now player shaming well let me tell the democrats let me tell the mainstream media although i repeat myself there has never been a time in the history of this country when we needed prior more the very first right protected in the first amendment and the bill of rights is religious liberty the right of every single one of us to seek out and worship the lord god almighty with all of our hearts minds and soul president obama back in was caught the rather candid video where he described those of us not on the heat the left coast not on the east coast as bitter and angry and clinging to our god and our guns well let me tell you were not better but were getting pretty angry and president of god or guns and then theres the second amendment yesterday here in iowa we announced our national second amendment coalition over patriots across this country standing for the second amendment now the media immediately sniffed it was insensitive to talk about the second amendment after the san bernardino terrorist attack and they tell you something i dont view it as my job to be sensitive to islamic terrorists the left immediate reaction to radical islamic terrorists like kittens with their eyes closed is not to go after the bad guys but immediately to try to seize the guns of lawabiding citizens the new york times on the front page as an editorial saying what we need to do is finally in the epidemic of private gun ownership in america let me tell the editors of the time something you dont stop the bad guys by taking away our guns you stop the bad guys by using our guns it is in an era of radical islamic terrorism that the second amendment is more important because listen it is not about hunting not about targeting those are both great fun but thats not what the second amendment is about the second amendment is about about the godgiven right of every american to protect your home and your life and your children and your family and it is fundamentally as our framers told us a check on government tyranny and then lets talk about security just like the federal government goes after lawabiding citizens they fail to identify and target the real enemies back six years ago the fort hood shooting nadal his son communicated with anwar alawlaki and known radical islamic terrorists inquired about lelaki about the permissibility of waging jihad against his fellow soldiers the obama administration knew all of this and they did nothing they did not prevent that terrorist attack because it would be politically incorrect let me tell you if anyone contacts that radical islamic cleric and ask is it permissible for me to murder others the federal government should step in and stop that terror attack before they kill and install you look at in boston the boston bombing the sarnia brothers we knew they were radical islamic terrorists the fbi when interviewed them but then they dropped the ball they stopped paying attention to the elder brother posted on youtube i called you and yet the government it stopped paying attention and they carried out a terror attack look you need to complicated surveillance you needed someone paying attention to youtube and you look at san bernardino what do we know about this couple we know that the man the jihadist there ran in the circles with worry encountered multiple people on terrorist watch list he flew to the middle east we know that his wife came into this country on a fiancee visa by the way the exact same visa venting that the obama administration promises us will keep us safe from terrorists among syrian refugees we know that she put on her visa application a nonexistent address which the obama administration didnt bother to notice and we know that the female jihad it contacted isis and publicly using social media proclaimed her allegiance to isis how about the federal government the obama administration spend less time trying to read your and my emails and phone calls and more time stopping radical islamic terrorists elected president we will defeat radical islamic terrorists no longer will we have a president who insist the islamic state is an islamic thats just naughty theres a reason it isnt called the presbyterians state instead we will have a president who will make clear we will utterly destroy isis we will carpet bomb them into oblivion glowinthedark but were gonna find out and we are gonna make abundantly clear to any militant on the face of the planet if you go enjoy nice is it you wage jihad against the united states of america and tried to murder innocent americans you were signing your death in recent weeks president obama traveled abroad he said he doesnt believe in american leadership and he doesnt believe in america winning he doesnt have time for that i gotta say fdr and jfk and ronald reagan must have been spinning in their graves to hear an american president say he doesnt believe in american leadership for america winning all i can tell you my philosophy on radical islamic terrorism to borrow a page from ronald reagan in the cold war is very very simple we win they lose thank you im not gonna stop the applause now senator cruises that on my radio program many times and ive asked him many questions as ive asked many questions of many of the people here but the next question is not for me or even the audience its from a guy who ran a pretty good campaign and i think we all admire former presidential candidate and wisconsin governor scott walker here like iowa discuss this heavily dependent on manufacturing and agricultural jobs sadly the obama administrations epa put in place new regulations that will cost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs and their shoes youve cost for the question as simple as president what will you do make federal rating agencies more responsible reasonable farmers and manufacturers to great question and a very important question for seven years the federal government has been at war with farmers with ranchers with small businesses and weve been trapped in stagnation im reminded of several years ago i was in west texas i ask folks there i said whats the difference between regulators and locust i said well the thing is you cant use pesticide on the regulators and its all west texas farmer he leaned back said wanna bet we need a president who stands with farmers and ranchers and small businesses against the locus descending from washington if i am elected president we will go after the epa we will repeal the waters of the united states rule which tries to give the federal government control of of the farm land and land in the state of iowa we will repeal obamacare we will repeal the death tax we will adopt a simple flat tax we will abolish the irs iranian the regulators you need a president willing to take on the bureaucratic state you know what barack obama has done that is wrong with executive power the good point but he has intruded into the article one lawmaking authority of congress under the constitution the president cant make the law changed the law or ignore the law not pledge on my first day in office to risks and every single illegal and unconstitutional executive ak but under article pilita constitution the president has robust authority to execute the laws and we have never once seen a president willing to take on the regulatory state here is the sad pattern when democrats are in office regulations grow exponentially when republicans are in office regulations still grow just a little more slowly as a cynical friend of mine suggested once we should make a bumper sticker republicans we waste less we have never seen a president willing to use the full article to executive power of the presidency to go after the regulatory state to fire regulators to repeal regulations and i give you my word today if im elected president but compromise if and when it will not be the case that regulations will have grown more slowly but it will be the case that by the end of that tenyear the body of federal regulations will be materially smaller and human liberty an equal amount larger as the format goes the first questions on video to second questions in person so the second question is gonna be asked by congress or dried blood blocking the st district senator crews here instead of figures questions out myself i did something i thought was much better when two people smarter than i my constituents his first questions from tim byrdak genuine standup hello jims a farmer in northeast iowa raises hog farms over a thousand acres question to use this to a lot of iowans it seems that washington dcs completely incapable of fixing our countrys addiction to spending and debt we just dont feel like politicians are actually serious about fixing this problem everyone talks about it but no one does anything what specifically will your administration due to put america back on the path to fiscal responsibility and rain in the unseasonable unsustainable spending before we run out of time the outset i want to thank the men and women of iowa for sending ron blum to fight for you and conquer your rod is a warrior for liberty and the washington cartel despises this man there is the reason that both rod and i need food tasters in the members dining room so i appreciate having an ally who will stand for fiscal responsibility and stand against the bipartisan corruption of washington and ron is a ferocious and very effective and your question is very very important we have out of control spending in washington the biggest thing that will turn around the debt is economic growth you look at our federal balance sheet thats the only firstorder variable thats why my top two legislative priorities or repealing obamacare and a simple flat tax because economic growth transformed everything else but when it comes to reining in spending youve also got to be willing to take on the washington cartel the term i use for the career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests and grow and grow and grow government now ive rolled out a detailed spending cutting plan of over billion dollars as specific cuts that we need to make about line agencies we should abolish the department of education department of commerce the department of energy hard and they are and beyond that about line specific programs nine will make a confession and at the last debate i listed the five departments for the agencies and i screwed up i left out education and i listed commerce twice so immediately all the folks in the media they were laughing up another republican forgot it so i went to megan kelly afterwards i said listen theres so much cronyism at the department of commerce we need to abolish it twice strong balance budget we need to pass term limits fundamental entitlement reform to strengthen and preserve social security and medicare and youve got it in the culture of corporate welfare and handouts and cronyism and giveaways that has corrupted washingtondc make a final point on that you know everyone on that republican presidential debate stage they talk about standing up to washington they talk about standing up to cloning us but the natural followup question that i think the voters are asking is ok well who actually has stood up to washington has taken on not just democrats but leaders in our own party and ill tell you two very simple principles the first description you shall know them by their fruits and the second is from human powers of observation nobody nobody nobody ever arrived at pennsylvania avenue and then grew a backbone thank you very much congressman are right we have a third question this one back to being on tape and the debate on this network is a little rough but there is a shining star there cnbcs larry kudlow in recession on inauguration day and weve had the slowest most tepid recovery since world war two what three steps would you immediately proposed in your first week and trivia question as i said the first thing i will do an officers wrist and everything illegal and unconstitutional executive amnesty in addition to that i will repeal the waters of the united states rule in addition to that i will approve the keystone pipeline in addition to that i will authorize the export of crude oil in addition to that i will open up the export of liquid natural gas in addition to that i will take on the epas blend wall that is preventing ethanol and biofuels from having a larger share of the market place in addition to that i will repeal the congressional exemption from obamacare and we will systematically go through the fact federal regulatory body for the federal rules that are strangling jobs and economic growth and we will remove the barriers to unchain small businesses and farmers and ranchers you know you need a president willing to take on the regulatory stated an easy now we all know that president obama has abused executive power but theres a silver lining to that everything done with the executive power can be undone with executive power and you know every republican candidate promises to take on regulation but inevitably when they get to washington they dont do it and they dont do it because the cartel fights back in memory back the beginning of the george w bush administration first couple of weeks they rescinded a regulation on arsenic and immediately the front page of the newspapers all the tv news programs said bush want our kids to drink arsenic and they pounded a living daylights out of the administration the intended effect was to say dont mess with the regulatory state dont resend dont pull back at you one way ratchet where government power gets bigger and bigger and bigger if your gonna change that youve got to have the political will to stand up and take the beating from the media thats the only way to turn around you gotta have the political courage to have a strategic legal plan to stand up and fire bureaucrats to travel for example to foggy bottom minitel the career foreign service at the state department if you have a different foreign policy if you disagree with the foreign policy the president united states youre welcome to find other employment you know i have jokes there is one government agency i would consider expanding dramatically and that is our embassy in iceland we may well need about people there because if you transferred ten thousand bureaucrats iceland it would have a powerful clarifying effect across the federal government and i tell you a very important message for congressional leadership to hear both republicans and democrats is if you passed legislation filled with corporate welfare filled with poor if you pass legislation like the senate just did this week reauthorizing the export import bank if you behave like youre working for the corporate lobbyists in washington instead of for the american people i will veto that legislation the final point to make is this listen breaking the washington cartel isnt easy they fight hard when i say we should repeal obamacare and abolish the irs im not remotely naive or pollyannish i dont think thats easy i know that we couldnt do that in the current congress the only way to do it think back to the last time we broke the washington cartel he was the reagan revolution where reagan took the case to the people and just like the men and women gathered here today the reagan revolution arose from the grassroots its weapons across this country and it transformed this country how do you change it you change the incentives in washington you know theres an old joke that politics is hollywood for ugly people my wife says i resemble that remark how do you change it lets go back to tip oneill the democratic speaker of the house told ronald reagan dont send your tax cut plan to me its dead on arrival ive got twenty democrats to kill it now reagan decrying his beer he didnt go sit down and pal around with tip oneill and buy me a drink he took the case to the american people he took the case to the american people that reagan revolution rose up and phone call after phone call after phone call came in and suddenly all of these democratic members of congress who had been knows said holy cow if i stand in the way of this theyre gonna throw me an office im gonna have to get an honest and votes became becoming she became became the largest tax cut in the history of this country how do you enact fundamental reform i intend to make the election a referendum on repealing obamacare and adopting a simple flat tax to abolish the irs and if we come out in november with a mandate from the people thats how we get it done the only thing strong enough is we the people united as the men and women in this room standing up and leading and let me say iowas starts this process iowa has a bullhorn and anna pedestal to speak to the nation and i am so grateful for the passion for the principle for the commitment to liberty in the constitution of the men and women in this room you are changing america and im proud to be standing withcreative thinking and energy energy that i believe is needed to change the direction of this country its also particularly fitting that were here today and in just a few months we will be celebrating the th anniversary of one of ronald reagans most important speeches a speech that he gave right here at this institution initiating an endowment drive that led to so much good in reagans times in a row at that speech reagan discuss the present challenges including the threat of terrorism and in particular he talked about the corrective that the usair force had just sent to colonel qaddafi in libya encouraging him to give up terrorism the corrective came in the form of the military jet and a bomb down his front porch but i especially like president reagans description of how one of his most famous appointees un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick once explained to the rest of the world what it meant to have conservatives in charge of foreign policy first he talked about the us governments approach towards terrorism quote donation friend or foe a liar adversary should be surprised by the events of last week he said of the recent and deliberate bombing his actions made clear his determination to protect american lives in the world from terrorism and then he singled out ambassador kirkpatrick and yet even at the start of the administration people like jean kirkpatrick were offering some pretty broad hints that things will be different how the reagan administration change american foreign policy she was asked to at the united nations she answered correctly she said well weve taken down our kick me sign and someone said well does this mean that if the united states has kicked it will kickback not necessarily she said but it does mean we wont apologize well we havent been apologizing things are different and perhaps youve noticed i know colonel qaddafi has that was reagan here at heritage thirty years ago challenges that ronald reagan and jean kirkpatrick faced in their times were daunting first and foremost the threat of soviet communist a threat that many in america thought could not be beaten we were told that an almost daily basis by elected officials by academics by those in the media but with a focus a determination and an unshakable belief in the greatness of our exceptional nation president reagan won the cold war today were once again facing challenging times both at home and abroad again we face an aggressive enemy whose goal is nothing less than the eradication of our very way of life and there are many in this country who fear once again that we cannot defeat this enemy that even speak its name labels us bigots it reminds me of that line from the movie the usual suspect the greatest trick the devil ever played was to convince the world he didnt exist it seems when it comes to president obama and hillary clinton radical islamic terrorism is something that just doesnt exist but the rest of us living on terra firma living in the real world are aware that it is real it is growing and it is profoundly dangerous what america needs today as a moment clearing our enemy as radical islamic terrorism and this is an enemy that can and will be defeated as we enter the final year of the obama administration for all that there is indeed a god there is little hope that this president will rise to the challenge and a much greater likelihood that his successor will be dealing with an even more dangerous world and what we face today issues will demand the attention of our next president keeping america safe at home and strong abroad ensuring both should be the basic responsibility in the first priority of any commanderinchief the recent terrorist attacks on paris and san bernardino abroad frontandcenter the issue of radical islamic terrorism but the fact of the matter is that the problem has been festering unattended for the entire obama administration of president obama however such issues are peripheral at best to ask or progressive agenda an agenda that a pieces are enemies before actually defending the national security interests of our great country while the president and his secretaries of state have chosen to ignore the problem and to recede from global leadership terrorist groups like i system mobilize and carried out a string of deadly attacks around the globe it is worth noting that the attack on san bernardino has been called the deadliest terror attack on uss doyle innocent lives murdered that depiction is actually incorrect weve had one other terror attack on you on us soil that took lives and it occurred in my home state of texas at fort hood on november th that likewise claimed lives the little aspect victim the unborn baby a private francesca valdez was brutally murdered along with her mother as nadal hasan shouted a little haha far the obama administration responded to this unspeakable terrorist attack by labeling it workplace violence one of the things im most proud of my tenure in the senate is introducing legislation in the senate armed services committee to mandate that the victims of the fort hood shooting received the purple heart and against the active opposition of the obama pentagon i was very pleased to earn the support of both democrats and republicans on the armed services committee we pass that legislation into law in december and april this year finally the purple heart was awarded to those victims of terrors whether its fort hood san bernardino or a number of others tragically in between from little rock to boston to garland to chattanooga president obamas approach has been to treat each one and isolation the administration has called the perpetrators lone wolves not to be associated with formal groups like alqaida crisis because they didnt receive direct orders from them they investigate any suspects but they ignore the reality that our nation is under attack what america needs today just as we need in the late nineteen seventies is first a form firm resolve to always protect americans freedom here at home freedom that has made this the greatest nation on the face of the planet but secondly need moral clarity that starts with defining the enemy and third we restore americas leadership in the world through a position of strength how do we do that first we protect americans freedoms here at home americans no longer feel safe in their schools their workplaces their cities it should not be the new standard this is not the new normal i do not have to precious little girls caroline and catherine their seven and five every time i pick them up every time i hold him in my arms i want them to be confident that they are protected and far from any everything home and a safe america starts with a secure america it is beyond time now to secure our border when terrorists can simply swim across the rio grande we are daring them to make this journey when forty percent of a legal immigration in our country comes from visa overstays we are inviting evil actors twogame our system as was the case with one of the hijackers and when we are opening up our countrys to thousands of refugees from regions filled with terrorists paris with the express intent to kill us our immigration policy ceases to be merely an economic or social ques border security is national security we need a president with the political will to secure the border once and for all and i have outlined a detailed immigration plan to do just that it includes finally completing all hundred sevenmonth all seven hundred miles of the wall mandated by federal law that the obama administration refuses to built tripling the border patrol increasing fourfold the fixedwing and rotarywing aircraft to monitor the border and direct boots on the ground where attempted to curtains occurring finishing the biometric exit entry system for our visas again mandated by federal law again ignored by the obama administration and putting in place a strong everify system it includes deporting criminal illegal aliens it includes ending welfare benefits for those here illegally and includes ending the indefensible practice of catchandrelease have also introduced legislation in the senate to halt our refugee program from those coming from terror ridden countries in syria in particular there is no question that the humanitarian disaster is horrific millions of people have been displaced by the savage violence millions are now living in camps that place severe strain on the resources of our allies and its natural that out of our generosity we want to help stop that misery and while the united states has been the largest donor to the refugee caused by a factor of getting billion dollars of taxpayer funds ten times what any other nation has contributed we cannot make the mistake of extending the same generosity to the extended imperiling the safety and security of american citizens the first obligation of the commanderinchief is to protect the safety and security of the united states of america to recent episodes make clear the need for more vigilance the first is the paris attacks which took one hundred and twenty lives we now know that one of the bombers had arrived in france under the guise of being a refugee it only takes one in a sea of millions to destroy our safety and to take unknown numbers of innocent lives the second instances fresh in the minds and hearts of people across our country just over a week ago a muslim couple who had pledged their support to isis murdered fourteen americans in san bernardino the woman ashley malik came to this country on the fiancee visa application should have set up any number of red flags including a fake address and pakistan but should have been fairly simple to track down but they went unnoticed yesterday fbi director james coming testified to congress that the two terrorists had been contact in contact online before she came to the country and it discussed martyrdom and jihad this appears not to be a love story between two young pious muslims but rather the deliberate infiltration by an enemy america who came here to plot and carry out a terrorist attack on our citizens this must stop now i will also know there are some on both the right and the left who want to exploit the current crisis by calling on americans to surrender our constitutional liberties as the only way to ensure our safety the bill of rights is altogether compatible with protecting the safety and security of american citizens on the right there are some who have called for resurrecting the governments bulk data collection that existed under the patriot act more data from millions of lawabiding americans is not always better data holding tens of billions of records of ordinary citizens it didnt stop fort hood it didnt stop busting it didnt stop chattanooga it didnt stop garland and it failed to detect the san bernardino blog when the focus of law enforcement and national security is on lawabiding citizens rather than targeting the bad guys we miss the bad guys while violating the constitutional rights of american citizens instead the bulk data program was emblematic of the bureaucratic tendency to gather more not better information which gives government tremendous opportunity for abuse as has been displayed powerfully by louis learners irs like the fable of the scorpion and the frog government will do what is in its nature amass power at the expense of the people this week we commemorated the th anniversary of pearl harbor let it be a reminder that it is often not a lack of intelligence but a lack of perception i cosponsored the usa freedom act to enable the intelligence community to find prosecute and kill the bad guy while protecting ordinary citizens privacy rights indeed under the usa freedom act intelligence capabilities are enhanced those are not my words those are the words of james clapper the director of national intelligence as he told congress this past may under the usa freedom act investigators have more tools to target suspected terrorists to access their phone records to track down those with whom theyve communicated under the old bulk data program all of us were presumed guilty at the outset and yet the universal phone records that could be searched was materially smaller than the universe that can now be searched under the usa freedom act that has expanded the number of phones that can be targeted but requires first some evidence that the persons phone youre going after is actually connected with terrorism we should not shy away from smarter policies that enhance our ability to target the bad guys while protecting the rights of lawabiding citizens in addition to those voices on the right who are suggesting sweeping aside citizens fourth amendment rights their voices on the left who are taking the same approach and want us to voluntarily surrender our nd amendment rights both of these approaches are misguided and chief among them going after the second amendment rights of lawabiding citizens is our president with all due respect president has it exactly backwards we dont stop the bad guys by giving away our guns we stop the bad guys by using our guns lets be very clear the second amendment is not the enemy my sis is radical islamic terrorism is those who want to murder us are as just a few joseph story so rightly noted the second amendment is the palladium of our liberties these rights enabled an armed citizenry to defend themselves against evil actors whether they be criminals or as we are now saying the threat increase homegrown or migrant terrorists around cities rather than stripping ordinary citizens of their constitutional liberties we should have instead a clear strategy to utterly defeated ice and that brings me to my second point in addition to protecting americans here at home the strategy to defeat the enemy begins by calling it by its name radical islamic terrorism on sunday the presidents address to the nation he made an interesting point he said quote for seven years confronted this evolving threat each morning and my intelligence briefing yet though he says he understands this evolving threat each day hes chosen not to deal with the reality hes chosen not to confront the actual enemy hes chosen not to call the attacks in fort hood or little rock or boston or chattanooga concerted acts of radical islamic terrorism on our own citizens our own mothers and fathers and sons and daughters and servicemen and women we need to take off the blinders a political correctness that prevent us from seeing what is right in front of us that enemy is radical islamic terrorism and it is trying to destroy our country and our way of life in a wall street journal column last week peggy noonan wrote about the need for us to robustly defend our first amendment right to free speech against the forces that are trying to shame us into silence its a topic for another speech but in this context it raises the specter that americans will be labeled as bigots if they dare utter the word islam in connection with a terrorist attack our president refuses to do so in fact he said spent a significant portion of a sunday address as an apologist for radical islamic terrorists and as attorney general loretta lynch told a gathering the day after the san bernardino attack that her department would move to prosecute anyone whose quote antimuslim rhetoric quotes and used towards violence the day after a terror attack innocent lives snuffed away we want a president and an attorney general who is standing up to defend this nation not an attorney general who decreased herself the speech police or any who dare speak out against this threat as has been the case all too often the obama administration we may be facing once again the weaponization of one of our own government agencies deployed not to protect americans but to force them to submit to the obama administrations code of what is and is not acceptable speech tourney general lynch said thats what she was most afraid of that we might exercise our first amendment rights and speak out against this threat how about having an attorney general who is focused on keeping our children safe rather than muzzling the free speech rights of americans and in fact were already seeing the consequences of fear stifling speech the neighbors of syed farooq and tash veena malik reportedly found their behavior up until now they didnt say anything to law enforcement because they were scared they would be accused of racial profiling imagine how different san bernardino would have played out out if the fear and political correct this its not silenced the neighbors if a phone call had been made if law enforcement had investigated if they had discovered the abundant evidence of radicalization and intent to wage jihad then if these to admit apprehended before they went on a murderous spree loretta lynch is ban on what she calls antimuslim rhetoric is already producing its chilling effect and its providing americans from taking basic steps to protect ourselves so lets take off the blinders its time to say that these attacks are not isolated incidents these walls are not alone there instead operating as an ideological pack and the thing that unites them is their fanatical adherence to islamic supremacism the conviction that the world must submit to their form of islam or die disabled forces present in our country as the fbi director reported it is active in each one of our fifty states and once we have identified the enemy was do everything in our power to defeat them america and the world have grown more dangerous as president obama has receded from the world stage every day goes by the united states seamless weaker and more marginal actor increasingly dismissed as irrelevant increasingly viewed by the worlds leaders are president has a laughing stock and so our third goal must be to restore americas leadership in the world as reagan knew well the best way to project americas leadership is by protecting and promoting americas strength and this principle should always got our actions president will have to contend with an ever worsening state of american interest around the globe given the opportunity squandered in the enemies and boldin under president obamas watch our most immediate challenge comes from the middle east which is what i want to talk about today but make no mistake about it this is a global problem and significant potential for conflict from the baltics to the south china sea are made ever more difficult by president obama shameful and destructive to funding of our military given president obamas detached and dismissive address to the nation on sunday night it is now a virtual certainty that the next president will have to deal with the scourge known as the islamic state and then it will not be a local threat we now know for a fact that if we drove withdraw from the middle east the radical jihadists will not be content to stay there theyre going to attack our allies in the region and beyond and they are on the lookout for every opportunity to attack us here at home the next president will need to bring together the best civilian and military leadership to develop an actual in real plan to utterly defeat and destroy isis a plan that is not shackled by concerns over environmental impact or the most restrictive rules of engagement that our armed forces have ever known during the fifteen months of president obamas failed military action against isis i have strongly advocated for a concrete military plan and proposed at options we may employ would include maximizing our overwhelming air advantage with a sustained coherent directed bombing campaign instead of what we have now which is a photo op foreign policy of a bomb here and a missile theyre not actually achieving the goal of defeating isis we should also be arming the courage the peshmerga who had considerable success against crisis despite the fact that isis is fighting with american military equipment they seized in iraq and the peshmerga are using out happens because the obama administration for political reasons refuses to arm them because they would displease baghdad our focus should not be incurring favor with baghdad our focus should be on utterly defeating the crisis and the kurdish pesh merga are critical boots on the ground for accomplishing that effort beyond that we should also include the jordanian and egyptian militarys in which the united states has made significant investments in past decades and then above and beyond that we should do whatever is necessary and required to defeat us some in the course of a political campaign have focused on the question of boots on the ground american boots on the ground as a talismanic demonstration of strength that is getting the deployment of military force precisely backwards this is not a game of risk where politicians move armies around to demonstrate their much east instead you need a commanderinchief who sets an objective of destroying isis and then we need to rely on the expert military judgment as to the tools necessary to carry out that objective including overwhelming military power including arming the kurds including using whatever ground troops are necessary to kill the terrorists and then come home the issue of isis is however only one piece of the complex geopolitical landscape of the middle east and id like to turn now to how we productively approach this troubled region in a way that will improve the broader strategic posture of the united states thirtysix years ago last month the remarkable intellect and diplomat who i mentioned earlier jeane kirkpatrick published an essay on commentary entitled dictatorships and double standards it is an essay to which i command everyone here today she wrote to disprove the notion that the prime directive of american foreign policy should be quote to democratize governments anytime anywhere under any circumstance that particular target of ambassador kirkpatrick criticism plus the fact listen on more foreign policy of our th president jimmy carter convinced that democracy was in and of itself an abstract force for good the carter administration had supported theoretically liberal uprisings against authoritarian governments that had been allied with the united states from latin america to the middle east however well intentioned president carters efforts may have been the result had been time and time again material damage to the national security interests of the united states dictatorships and double standards appear the same month that the revolutionary leader of the islamic republic of iran the ayatollah told the khomeini who seized power unopposed by the carter administration had gone on to take more than hostages at the american embassy in tehran hostages that he would hold for days ambassador kirkpatrick political philosophy caught the attention of an inspiring republican presidential candidate ronald reagan the tireless champion of freedom and human rights had been grappling with the issue of how to advance the american cause against the soviets when many of our potential partners were not exactly paragons of democratic virtue reagan understood the hard truths embodied in dictatorships and double standards which was that is established liberal democracies are not the only valuable allies for america they are rather the best ones and are to be prioritized celebrated and fiercely protected but if we refuse to work with countries that do not meet our democratic standards for not making a rapid enough conversion to democracy but are still helpful to advancing our larger goals to protecting our national security then we risk fundamentally undermining those goals and so to our national security now reagan absorb this concept without ever losing his passionate belief in freedom he knew that the real threat was not the occasional dime store dictator but rather the existential threat of totalitarian communism which was on the march with the stated goal of world domination and he knew that this is not an either or dilemma even as he kept vitally important and alliances with the philippines and south korea he used quiet diplomacy and sometimes very public diplomacy to successfully encouraged these nations to more democratic practice would it be nice if the progress of liberal democracy was an inevitable linear evolution and human affairs and that freedom once achieved would be a permanent state of affairs indeed it would but even a cursory glance at the history of democracy in the some two and a half millennia since the experiment was first attempted in ancient athens reveals this is far from the case and the reality is that in order to preserve and strengthen the united states we cannot true meat treat democracy promotion as an absolute directive but rather as a highly desirable ideal one that can be reached most effectively through the promotion of the security in the interest of the united states we could do worse in my opinion that adopting the reagan kirkpatrick philosophy today after all the proof is in the pudding and it is not an accident that when the american hostages were released on january th they came home not because president carter had allowed the islamic revolution to triumph on a post but because now a president reagan was in the white house and the ayatollah knew he would defend america one recent case study what if interested president reagan and ambassador kirkpatrick was the january popular uprising in tahrir square that ousted hosni mubarak mubarak made an easy target an aging military strongman with a grin record on human rights the fact that he had been for thirty years a staunch ally of the united states and a key partner in securing israel was quickly to scout it the google field revolution was ahead a moment that same day twenty first century rebuke to the repression of the past mubarak small was hailed as an opportunity for egypt to chart a new and more hopeful democratic future and plans were made for speedy elections when those elections came however the results were disastrous for the united states as mohammed morsi who had close ties with the muslim brotherhood came to power but barack obama insisted that all that mattered was that morsi was duly elected and for that reason the egyptian should have to suffer under his brutal world even while he started to undermine american interests destroy the egyptian economy and allowed jihadists and weapons to flow from libya into the sinai for the second uprising in the summer of would not be the id ideal way to change government we should all shudder to think what could have happened in egypt had morsi laying out his term we might well have faced the prospect of egypt on the brink of failure unable or unwilling to protect israels borders from the radical islamics that morsi had unleashed now under president lcc we have a leader who is aggressively fighting the terrorist cells in the sinai and defending his border with libya and who is not afraid to call out the terrible perversion of his own faith that is causing the violence this past summer i wrote a book entitled the time for truth in that book highprofile a speech president morsi gave on january st of this year at cairo university it was a speech in which he called out directly the threat of radical islamic terrorists it was a speech in which he called out fellow muslims to stand up against the perversion against the evil that is radical islamic terrorists but president morsi president lcc rather for president on sisi to give this speech as a muslim leader was a demonstration of courage and resolve that was remarkable he was quite literally putting a bounty on his own hand and he did so with his eyes open fully aware that the forces of evil he was standing up against would do everything they could to murder him as a result and yet as i discussed in the book what does it say when the president of egypt is more cleareyed more candid more direct more serious about defeating radical islamic terrorism then is the present in the united states indeed at that very same university cairo university president obama outspoken and on a socalled world apology to her or a set among other things that iran has a right to nuclear power we need a president who will stand up and unequivocally defend the national security interests of this country another instructive episode was the nato led intervention in libya that toppled the repressive dictator moammar kadafi he made it easier even easier target the move mark a violent and repressive anti american dictator who had sponsored vicious terrorist attack on american interest notably the downing of pan am flight over lockerbie scotland gaddafi had also long been suspected to push it pursuing cover a covert nuclear program that if successful would pose a great threat to the united states when a popular uprising occurred in the spring of it seemed a nobrainer to this administration that america would come to the aid of the beleaguered rebels splashed across the international press in fatigues and get fios the mission seemed almost absurdly easy one that could be executed with no real american sacrifice indeed as the obama administration boasted we could quote lead from behind and the result would be the establishment of a liberal democracy in libya that would only require administrative steps such as mobilizing international support for a transitional government and freeing up communications networks how profoundly wrong that poor foreign policy view was as it turns out rather than being aspiring democrats that the obama administration and their allies wanted them to be the rebels were radical jihadists with limited interest in establishing a civil society and while it was at the time well known that qaddafi and abandon his nuclear program another very real threat of military intervention that he perceived from the george w bush administration it was less well known that he had begun cooperating with the united states and the fight against those same violent terrorist but he was actively working to apprehend radical islamic terrorists to turn them over to america know once he was gone things turn for the worse once he was gone in less than months they would overrun our facilities in benghazi murdering four americans including our ambassador the first american ambassador killed in the line of duties since the carter administration today libby is a failed state controlled by warring terrorist networks that pose a significant threat to our ally egypt and who are openly plotting attacks on our allies in europe the intervention in libya libya was in a word a disaster and the argument that republicans had to in principle support what might have been a democratic uprising against gadhafi but that the obama administration somehow botched the job is revisionist history and poor revisionist history at that this took place in after the presidents cairo speech the russian reset and the canceling of the missile defense batteries in poland and the czech republic it should have been clear to any rational observer that the obama administration was not capable of a policy that would actually defend and robustly defend the national security interests of the united states a third example that has dragged on for more than four years is the syrian civil war once again there is no doubt that bashar alassad like his father was before him as a bad guy who has been an ally to end it as a puppet of iran and an enemy to the united states and israel and it may have been that this spring of there was a secular nonviolent opposition to assad that would have made his ouster of strategic interest to the united states but by the time i arrived in congress in it was clear that far darker forces were at work in june of that year the economist reported that out of the nine rebel groups that they had identified seven had significant terrorist ties a state of affairs that made me deeply cautious about any plan to train and equip them for as bad as assad was and is radical jihadist controlling syria would be a significant turn for the worse nothing that has happened in the last two and a half years has given me any more confidence that intervention in the syrian civil war is in americas interest in fact the situation is now materially worse despite hundreds of millions of dollars the united states has poured into trying to identify and train the syrian opposition as isis now controls a significant portion of the country while assad is consolidating his position as a vassal of iran and russia quite simply we do not have a side in the syrian civil war is not very fashionable these days in washington indeed it is not difficult to find politicians in washington who will thunder we must topple assad with the same ferocity with which they thundered we must topple kadhafi we must topple mubarak and weve seen the catastrophic results of these myopic policies and i would note that my view that we dont have a side of the syrian civil war is shared by at least one other world leader with a cleareyed and direct vision to whats happening is rails prime minister netanyahu was asked when he visited washington last month why he didnt intervene in the in the syrian civil war and he responded simply that he would only do so if he had a clear side which at this point he did not he said that an iranian controlled assad was a disaster for israel but thats so was the islamic state controlling syria quote when two of your enemies are fighting each other i say dont strengthen one or the other i say we can both or at least dont intervene which is what ive done i believe today we are at a moment like munich in that president obama has returned from geneva returned from agreeing to give over a hundred billion dollars to the ayatollah khomeini promising like neville chamberlain peace in our time history teaches anything giving hundreds of billions of dollars strengthening homicidal maniacs who intend to murder you has never ever ever worked out well and at a time of great peril we need the churchillian clarity and vision that prime minister netanyahu provide because he doesnt have the time for the political correctness that so hamstrings the obama administration i think we should listen to our closest ally in the region and in the absence of a viable alternative to assad that isnt isis i believe we should focus on the immediate and unambiguous challenge to our security which is utterly destroying isis i understand this flies in the face of conventional wisdom holds that america must always promote democracy at all costs some would consider any progression in egypt involved morsi serving out his full term as unacceptable they might consider the terrorists domination of libya as preferable to any outcome that didnt oust the dictator qaddafi they are proclaiming today that those who do not support assads ouster are complicit in iranian terrorism there will always be those who believe it is americas obligation is a free nation to convince others that we are laboring for their freedom whether they want it or not there will always be those who believe by insisting on anything less than our democratic ideals we are forfeiting the moral high ground this is to borrow ambassador kirkpatrick elegant phrase nothing more than confusing revolution with idealism change with progress we do not betray the idea of america by accepting reality ronald reagan was the single greatest liberator of human oppression that the world has ever known he did not do it by forcing democracy on on whaling nations but by an unwavering determination to defeat communism after two terms that obama clinton foreign policy so disastrous it makes the carter administration look good we are in a desperate need once again for clarity the clarity of ronald reagans for most important words we win they lose they will not win by replacing dictators as unpleasant as they may be with terrorists who want to kill us and destroy america and we can take heart in the knowledge that like reagan were not abandoning freedom we are doing what we must be protected because the true threat to the spread of liberty is the radical islamism that is every bit as impressive as soviet communism and why the rebels who oppose regional strongman who turn out to be just hotties are not ultimately helpful in this cost there are others who are and we should be able to figure out the difference as ambassador kirkpatrick wrote it may not always be easy to distinguish between democratic in totality therrien agents of change but it is also not too difficult authentic democratic revolutionary is aimed at securing governments based on the consent of the government the governor and believed that ordinary men are capable of using freedom knowing their own interests and choosing leaders a case in point is perhaps the single greatest blunder of the obama administration and one of its first in when the president ignored the green revolution in iran and thereby forfeiting an opportunity to replace the radical islamist terror sponsor terrorist sponsoring regime in tehran that chance death to america and death to israel and pursues nuclear weapons and instead america could have stood with a peaceful secular rebellion that was crying out for support from the united states there was a case where regime change squared up with our most pressing national need but instead of standing with the iranian people in what could have been his tear down this wall moment instead president obama fell silent and decided to open up negotiations with the mullahs and stand so while the paroxysms of the socalled arab spring did not produce a wave of flowering democracies in the middle east but rather a tsunami of chaos and unrest including a new and even more virulent state strain of radical islamic terrorism most sensationally embodied by isis there maybe future such opportunities that the next president should not squander we couldnt lead by example and demonstrate the positive effects of democracy as ambassador kirkpatrick further noted it is not impossible to us policy could effectively encourage this process of liberalization and democratization provided to the effort was made at a time when the incumbent government is fighting for its life against violent adversaries and that the proposed reforms are aimed at producing gradual change rather than to protect democracy overnight to accomplish this policy makers are needed to understand how actual democracies have actually come into being history is a better guide than good intentions their number of encouraging twentiethcentury examples of liberalisation that should give us hope the flourishing vibrant democracy that israel is one of the great gifts the last seven decades have bestowed on america we shouldnt squander at the end of the cold war produced a unified democratic germany as well as the vibrant democracies of eastern europe all strategic allies and assets to the united states we can most effectively continue this process by embracing our own ideals by standing unapologetically for freedom by defending americans here in our country by having the courage to speak with moral clarity to call evil by its name by unapologetically defending americas interest around the globe and by using the bully pulpit of the presidency to invite others to recognize the rights of individuals to respect them and to unite against the evil forces who seek to tear down freedom in every corner of the world likegod bless the great state of florida im thrilled to be with you today well thank you and i love you too what an amazing how many of yall of watch the republican debates how fantastic is it that we have such an array of young talented dynamic candidates running for president rest with the democrats you know i i think the first democratic debate was was hillary and the trip only clerk well now actually thats not fair we cant forget about bernie sanders so now the democratic field consists of a wildeyed socialist with ideas that are dangerous for american the world and learning centers but i dont know if you heard they announced new news they changed the location for the next democratic debate were gonna have it at leavenworth what they wanted to make it easier for hillary to attend you know all of us are here today because our countries in crisis were here today because were bankrupting our kids and grandkids because our constitutional rights are under assault each and every day and because americas receded from leadership in the world and it is made the world a much more dangerous place and yet im here today with a word of hope and encouragement an exhortation to each of you all across this country all across the state of florida and all across the nation people are waking up and im here to tell you help is on the way so i wanna ask everyone here to look forward look forward to january if im elected president let me tell you what i intend to do on the first day in office the first thing i intend to do is risks and every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by this president president obama likes to say hes got a phone and hes got a pan where you live by the pan you die by the pin and my pen has got an eraser but sadly the corruptions not been limited to the white house has extended across every agency the federal government the second thing i intend to do on the first day in office is instruct the united states department of justice to open an investigation into planned parenthood and these horrible videos and a prosecute any and all criminal conduct by that organization the third thing i intend to do on the first day and all is instruct the department of justice and the irs and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty and today means that every serviceman and woman has the right to seek out and worship god almighty with all of our hearts minds and souls and their superior officer and nothing to say and that means that the little sisters of the poor a catholic charity being persecuted by the obama administration will find that the case against them has been dismissed the fourth thing i intend to do on the first day in office is ripped to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal greatest national security threat facing this country is the threat of a nuclear iran and we need a commanderinchief who will stand up in unequivocal terms and say under no circumstances will the nation of iran led by a theocratic ayatollah to chance death to america under no circumstances will iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons the fifth i intend to do on the first day in office is begin the process of moving the american embassy in israel to jerusalem the one senator no capital of israel now you know a lot of presidential candidates both democrats and republicans had made that same problems and yet inevitably when they get to the white house they dont do it because what happens is their team comes to them and they say you know if we do this other folks in the middle east will be really really unhappy with well if you hadnt noticed there are already pretty unhappy with the single biggest difference between me and the other very very fine men and women standing on that debate stage is that with me when i tell you im going to do something im gonna do exactly what i said thats day one there are days in a year for years in a presidential term and four years in a second term by the end of eight years theyre going to be a whole lot of reporters and newspaper editors and journalists check themselves into therapy in the days that follow i will go to congress and we will repeal every word of obamacare we will pass commonsense health care reform that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable and keep the government from getting in between us and our doctors what are these is obama coming in the days that followed i will instruct the us department of education which should be abolished i will instruct the secretary of education that common core ends today in the days that follow we will rebuild our military and we will honor the commitments made to our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and that includes protecting the rights of our service men and women to keep and bear arms and defend themselves that means that the next time a jihadist walks into a recruiting center in chattanooga hes going to encounter the business and of firearms wielded by a dozen marines we will finally finally finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities we will stop releasing criminal illegal aliens and we will pass case law in the days that follow we will take on epa and the cfpb and the alphabet soup of federal agencies that have descended like locusts on small business is killing jobs all across this great country in a few years back i was out west texas i ask folks there i said whats the difference between regulators and locust so well the thing is you cant use pesticide on the regulators and theres all west texas farmer he leaned back said one of the days that follow i will go to congress and we will pass fundamental tax reform we will pass a simple flat tax for every american so that every man and woman can fill out their taxes on a postcard and when we do that we should abolish the irs there about employees at the irs we need to padlock that building all ninety thousand put him down on our southern border now to our friends in the media i say that somewhat tongueincheek but you know if you think about it sir imagine you traveled thousands of miles in the blazing sun youre swimming across the rio grande and the first thing you see is irs agents you turn around and go home summar may be thinking of this makes sense to me its basic common sense live within your means dont bankrupt our kids and grandkids follow the constitution but can it be done scripture tells us is nothing new under the sun i think where we are today is very very much like the late nineteen seventies same failed economic policies same misery stagnation and malaise the same feckless and naive foreign policy in fact the exact same countries russia and iran openly laughing and mocking the president the united states and why is it that analogy gives me so much hope and optimism because we know how that story ended all across this country millions of men and women rose up and became the reagan revolution washington despised ronald reagan by the way if you see a candidate who washington embraces run and hide it came from the american people and it turn this country around we went from stagnation to booming economic growth to millions lifted out of poverty in a prosperity and the american dream we went from our hostages languishing in iran to winning the cold war and chairing the berlin wall to the ground the reason i am so hopeful and optimistic its the same thing is happening again we are seeing the american people wake up all over the country and a six months ago when we launched our campaign for president the new york times promptly opined crews cannot win because the washington elites despise him i kinda thought that was the whole point of the campaign but if you think things in washington are going great that we need to keep headed the same basic directions just kinda fiddle around the edges and i guy on the other hand if you think washington is fundamentally broken that there is a bipartisan corruption of career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests and grow and grow and grow government and we need to take power out of washington and back to we the people that is what this campaign is all about well you know the times continue they said okay maybe the grass roots are gonna be with gonna have any money all the money is controlled by those washington elites and the lobbyists are all supporting other candidates in this race funny thing happened on the way to the forum few weeks back all the campaigns filed their latest fundraising reports at a seventeen republican candidates who started this race do you know which campaign has the most cash on hand the most money in the bank we did you know how that happened because weve had over four hundred and fifty thousand contributions people all over the country going to check crews or crews or ted cruz or its ted cruz dunno average contribution was that is the power of the grass want to close with two things wanna statement about the role of florida florida and texas share a lot in common we are southern states which states that are growing which states that understand that economic growth doesnt come from government it comes from the men and women in this room it comes from small businesses that comes from entrepreneurs it comes from people creating opportunity and nothing where immigrants states people coming from all over the world to our states we also share a similar dislike for snow i like to tell people you cant shovel sunshine there is a reason people are fleeing hightax hi regulation states all over the country and come into states like florida and texas because jobs and opportunity and growth and the future is in states like florida and texas floridas primary is a critical time and florida can play a decisive role in ensuring that the next republican nominee for president is a strong concern we are building a grassroots army across florida and all across this country and i ask everyone here come and join us the last thing i want to say is this for every one of us here freedom is not some abstract concept we read about a school book freedom is real and personal in our lives and our families you know for me i think about my dad to years ago fled cuba it came to america with nothing was years old at sewn into his underwear he couldnt speak english he washed dishes making fifty cents an hour and it worked full time he paid his way through school he went on with my mother to start a small business today and my father is a pastor he travels the country preaching the gospel now my whole life my dad has been my hero but you know what i find most incredible about his story every one of us here we have a story just like that in our back some of us its us others its our parents others its our great great great great but what ties americans together is everyone of us we are the children of those who risk everything for free that is the fundamental dna of what it means to be an american to value liberty and opportunity above all else and it is why im so optimistic because we are not going to give up our freedom to an evergrowing federal government you know when i was a kid my dad used to say to me over and over again when we lost our freedom in cuba bleach we lose our freedom here that is why each and every one of us here today because we are not content to go quietly into the night we are not willing to give up on our children and grandchildren i tell you this if we continue to come together if we stand together to defend freedom to defend the constitution if we the people rise up as one we can bring back that last best hope for mankind that shining city on a hill that is the united states of america thank you and god bless youit is not often that im speechless but wow god bless the great state of iowa let me say day bart bob vander plaats steve king glenn beck what an incredible humbling powerful privilege to stand with warriors for liberty these are men of principle days are men of honor these are men who love our constitution these are men who love god and as our man who are not afraid to stand and speak the truth no matter what the consequences and times of great peril god as always elevated leaders and we have seen a panoply of leaders elevated to stand for this country and i gotta tell you every time glen speaks i learn something everyone here i think has received an hour of college credit from the bible college for glenn beck university puts everything in perspective on what the stakes are i will say this for a texan its cold outside let you know as cold as it as it is and its even colder in washingtondc blizzard hit washington shut down the government mainstream media immediately blamed it on me i have to admit though i saw a blizzard in washington i was confused i thought al gore said this would happen i mean it was cold air is cold there it is so cold in washington it is so cold i actually saw a democrat with his hands in his own pockets actually hillary and she was hiding an email server nine days nine days between now and the iowa caucus nine days in a battle that will decide the direction of this country every one of us is here for one reason we love this country and we recognize america is in crisis we love our children we love our grandchildren and i will tell you we have reason to be encouraged to the word tells us weeping may endure for a night but joy joy cometh in the morning across this country there has been a great deal of weeping weve seen the fundamental values of this country being torn down but from washington d c torn down by politicians in both parties and yet i want to give you a word of hope and encouragement and exhortation the american people are waking up there is an awakening and there is a spirit of revival that is sweeping this country you know glenn was right no one person can turn this country around it is only gods blessing walking through we the people that can pull this country back from the brink but every one of us understands the stakes im curious as anyone else in this room ever been burned by a politician we see it over and over again politicians come they gave a great talk they say exactly what we want to hear and then they go to washington and they dont do what they said they would do we keep winning elections are a republican house a republican senate and what on earth do they do with it over and over and over again the stakes are too high this election in we cannot get burned again so how do we decide how we as voters decide how do we avoid getting burned again a step ahead of me as gland rightly noted scripture tells us you shall know them by their fruits let me give a better suggestion listen and three republican when they run for president stands up and says there are conservative have you noticed that have you noticed that not a single person on that debate stage stands up and says hi im a squishy establishment moderate i stand for absolutely nothing they dont say that by the way what a tribute to the men and women here that establishment politicians are spending millions of dollars trying to convince us that they believe what we do so heres my advice dont listen to any of us dont listen to me and dont listen to anybody else on that stage instead of listening to what we say ask show me what youve done show me your path i dont know but also used to say if im ever accused of being a christian had like four there be enough evidence to convict me im gonna suggest a way for us not to get burned again ronald reagan talked talked about a time for choosing lines in the ground where men and women decide on which side of the line do i stand and i want to walk through seven times for choosing the first is life life is the fundamental interest value if we have no life no liberty follows no pursuit of happiness follows the right to life is fundamental to all else just this week we saw the tragic anniversary of roe versus wade decision that has authored in the death of over million unborn children now in a republican primary and recanted it will tell you theyre prolife thats what republicans do in presidential primaries the question we ought to ask is tell me when hit you stood up and fought for the right to life before being in the senate i was the solicitor general texas the chief lawyer for the state in front of the uss supreme court we led a coalition of states before the uss supreme court defending the federal ban on partialbirth abortion and we another coalition estates before the uss supreme court defending the state of new hampshires parental notification law and we won unanimous and when the state of texas passed legislation prohibiting taxpayer funding for planned parenthood a local district court struck it down i personally argued the appeal in the court of appeals and we won unanimously defunding planned parenthood the righttolife matters to you if it is a core principle in your life then the question each of us has to ask who can we trust who has a record on this i will tell you this if a candidate has spent the first sixty years of their life supporting partialbirth abortion it raises the question of what they might do in the white house if a candidate today as a candidate for president says we should continue funding for planned parenthood taxpayer funding it gives us real reason to doubt whether that candidate would lift a finger to defend life ill tell you this if im elected president on the first day in office i will direct the department of justice to open an investigation into planned parenthood and to prosecute any and all criminal violations if life matters theres a real difference in terms of records lets talk about a second time for choosing marriage and religious liberty marriages foundational to the family the best home for children its a home with a mother and father who are married who love each other and raise their children in a loving family a great many americans dont experiencing that i i come from a family where a lot of the people in my family were single moms and indeed for a period i was raised by a single mom when my dad left my mother and it was only my fathers coming to the lord and given his life to jesus that brought our family back together but for seven years weve seen a relentless assault on marriage and religious liberty from washington d c i still remember the week that president obama first came out against traditional marriage hiding and i are members of first baptist church in houston remember our pastor was mothers day that that particular weekend and our pastor got up and he was getting ready to preach a sermon and actually had a little fishing pond and a fishing pole he never uses proper for whatever reason he had them that morning and our pastor stood up and said you know what i was all prepared to give terrific sermon on mothers day he said god wont let me give that sermon because this week this past week for the first time in the history of our nation the president of the united states has come out against marriage as the union of one man and one woman and our pastor simply call and every member of the congregation he said were not gonna have a sermon this morning i just asked each of us to get down on our knees and lift up this country in prayer the spring the supreme courts decision on marriage in june of last year unelected judges purported to tear down the marriage laws of all fifty states they ignored the constitution they ignored the law of the land they claim to have more enlightened wisdom and what mankind has understood for millennia long before there was a united states long before there was a supreme court marriage was ordained by god as the union of one man and one woman when that decision came down that was another time for choosing and a republican candidate who responded to the gay marriage decision by saying it is the set of law of the land we must surrender accept it and move on those are wordforword the talking points of barack obama several of the individuals on that debate stage that was their position including the two leading contenders who are my competitors in this state they said its settled as the law of the land accept it and move on and my view anyone that echoes barack obama in handing authority over the court to tear down marriage we should know exactly what they would do as president which is they would be unwilling to defend match and when it comes to religious liberty religious liberty is the very first liberty protected in the first amendment of the bill of rights it is foundational the right that this nation was founded by brave men and women fleeing religious oppression and coming to a land where we could seek out and worship the lord god almighty with all of our hearts minds and souls without government getting in the way religious liberty for me has been a core principle has been that i had been fighting for four decades fighting to defend the ten commandments honda state capitol grounds going to the supreme court and winning the pledge of allegiance the words one nation under god going to the supreme court and winning unanimous veterans memorial representing three million veterans defending a lone white latin cross going to the supreme court and winning and see my friends pickin videoguard to iowa natives who are standing for their religious faith they lost their historic lutheran church that they had owned because they were persecuted because they were told they had to host and celebrate a homosexual wedding or face persecution by the government you know we hosted a religious liberty rally some months ago here in iowa incredible rally with nine heroes including deck and betty that just told their stories ordinary people a florist a baker a soldier a fireman who stood for their faces were persecute if you believe religious liberty is fundamental then the question we should ask every one of these candidates is not what do we say on the campaign trail its easy to say on the campaign trail ill defend religious liberty asked if every candidate what have you ever done in your life to stand and fight for religious liberty for choosing was the battle over guns and youre reading ahead we all remember the tragic shooting in newtown connecticut where a sick deranged individual murdered little children heidi and i as the father of two little girls and and mother of two little girls and by the way thank god our girls look like their mother proof that god is a benevolent guy but in the wake of that horrific shooting president obama could have chosen to try to bring us together could have chosen to work with democrats and republicans and say lets target violent criminals lets come down on them like a ton of bricks but instead following his chief of staffs advice you never want to let a good crisis go to waste what did the president do he did the same thing he did after san bernardino he said im gonna go after the second amendment right to keep and bear arms of lawabiding citizens well ill tell you millions of americans across this country rose up to defend our nd amendment rights our nd amendment right is a fundamental right in the bill of rights and by the way its not about hunting its target shooting those are great fun but thats not why the second amendment is in the bill of rights the second amendment is in the bill of rights because if anyone comes into your home to harm you or your family to harm your children you have a natural godgiven right to keep and bear arms and defend your family when millions of americans rose up to defend the second amendment right to keep and bear arms against a federal government that was trying to undermine it i was proud i was honored to lead that fight standing with the people the question you should ask every other candidate on that stage all of them say they support the second amendment where where they if they support the second amendment we had a fight it was fundamental it was the president trying to undermine the second amendment if you really support it your actions could demonstrate it by standing up suiting up and reporting for bad a fourth time for choosing obamacare take obamacare please take obamacare in millions of americans across this country rose up in an incredible tidal wave to say stop this disaster we dont want it taking our jobs forcing us into parttime work taking our health care taken our doctor driving our premiums through the roof that was a moment where i was proud to stand with millions of americans to try to give voice to the frustration to the anger to the rage why is the government undermining my ability to keep me and my family safe that was another moment a time for choosing to look to the other very very fine individual stand on that debate stage the question will naturally arise if you say you oppose obamacare where were you in when the fight is being fought where did you stand when the line was in the ground on which side to just stand and let me say right now if a republican candidate has for over years of his life embraced a bernie sanders style socialized medicine for oil and if that candidates still today as a republican candidate for president supports a bernie sanders socialized medicine for all is there any chance on earth that candidate would actually repeal obamacare do not listen to what we say look at what we do tell you if i am elected president we will repeal of obamacare that fifth time for choosing is taking on the cronyism of the washington cartel ive said many times the biggest divide weve got this country its politically its not between democrats and republicans it is between career politicians in washington in both parties and the american people every candidate on that debate stage says vote for me and i will stand up to washington ok great natural next question when have you ever stood up to washington we should ask every candidate who has stood up to washington whos taken on not just democrats but leaders in our own party nobody on earth ever grew a backbone after they got in pennsylvania avenue if a republican candidate for president supported barack obamas tarp bailout of the big wall street banks if a republican presidential candidate for president supported barack obamas stimulus and said the only problem is it needs to be bigger is there any chance on earth that individual would actually stand up to the cronyism and cartel in washington dont listen to what we say look at what we do next battle the sixth time for choosing was the battle over amnesty now we had as well on epic knockdown dragout battle president obama and chuck schumer and harry reid and the democrats joined up with establishment republicans to try to pass a massive amnesty bill the bill didnt secure our borders the bill expanded president obamas ability to bring in syrian refugees without mandating background checks and the bill would have granted amnesty to million people here illegally for everyone in this country that was a time for choosing on which side do you stands now there are individuals on that stage that answered that question and said i stand with chuck schumer and barack obama and i stand against the american people i can tell you i was proud to stand shouldertoshoulder with iowa zone steve king jeff sessions fighting to stop amnesty to secure the border to keep this country safe now the leader of that move for amnesty was my friend marco rubio a good man charming but when he ran for senate in florida he promised the people of florida if you elect me i will lead the fight against amnesty thats what he told the voters and then it came to washington and immediately joined with chuck schumer and authoring the rubio schumer amnesty bill now you remember when glenn talked about if youre not who you say you are if you break your work to the voters i will be your worst enemy look what i would say to each of you hold me accountable hold all of us accountable good yes the stakes are too high but i would notice well theres another candidate in this race who talks quite a bit about immigration and everything else well in the battle was being fought if it is in fact the case that mr trump opposes amnesty asked where was he during that battle i can tell you where he was he was publicly at the time supporting amnesty tweeting out support for the gang of eight he was publicly at the time supporting marco rubios dreamer legislation he was publicly at the time criticizing mitt romney for being too tough on illegal immigration down when it comes to amnesty even today the senate like donald trump he may say unpleasant things about me i have no intention of responding in kind i do not intend to insult him i like and respect and i respect the men and women here the men and women of iowa too much i dont think you want or need or deserve to see politicians engaging in namecalling and insults but i do think substance matters i think record matters i think issues matter and i will point out out that even right now today mr trump supports amnesty mr trumps proposal everyone knows he proposes to deport everyone here illegally but then he says as soon as they get back hell let him back in and let him become citizens by the way this is a proposal establishment republicans have talked about an awful lot called touch back touch back means youre flying back to the country they touch the ground and then they come back magically on a path to citizenship now hes entitled advocate for that a lot of establishment republicans have advocated for that but it doesnt get to pretend its not amnesty when hes making million people here illegally into twelve million usd ennis and let me say in its worth remembering what the stakes were in that battle the rubio schumer gang of eight amnesty bill had passed the united states senate republican leadership john boehner and house intended to take it up and pass it with the vote for the democrats to overrule almost all the republicans and pass it with a vote for the democrats if you doubt that talk to steve king and ask him exactly where it was hit it this was the battle if that had happened and it landed on barack obamas desk it be a done deal this fight would have been lost so if you in fact about securing the borders care about stopping amnesty what you did right there and then demonstrate your commitment to the back and the seventh and final time for choosing that i want to focus on is standing up to iran and radical islamic terrorism the single greatest national security threat facing this country is the threat of a nuclear read the most important determination the men and women of iowa will make the men and women of this country will make his who is best prepared to be commanderinchief who has the experience who has the knowledge who has the judgment who has the temperament who has the clarity of vision and strength of resolve to kill our enemies and to keep this country safe and so the question we should ask is who has stood up and led the fight against this iranian nuclear deal who has stood up and led the fight to go after radical islamic terrorism who is prepared to keep this country safe and i will say this any candidate who says they will get into office and leave in place obamas catastrophic nuclear deal does not understand the nature of the ayatollah khomeini if elected president on the first day in office i will rip to shreds this iranian nuclear deal the people of iowa nine days nine days to make this choice if you all agree with me that the stakes have never been higher that we are fighting to save this country or never were at the edge of a cliff and we either pull back or we risk losing the greatest country in the history of the world do you agree with me that i want to ask each and every one of you to do three things one join us commit today right now yes i will come out on monday night and caucus and stand with you strength of this campaign it is the grass root it is we the people i believe in the men and women of our i wanna ask if each of you is that you volunteer that yes sign up today and commit be a precinct leader be a county leader commit right now to pick up the phone and call your mom thats a good idea to call your mom anyway call your sister your son or your next door neighbor or your college roommate and say this election matters please come out and join me for my kids for my grandkids everyone of you i want to ask every person here to vote for me ten times now look were not democrats im not suggesting voter fraud but if every one of you gets nine other iowans to come out and caucus on monday night you will have voted ten times this is the fight right now listen you all in this creates state will be beset by millions of dollars of attack ads of tv ads of radio ads mailers with more and more and more horrific attacks and lies and as you get closer to caucus night itll get worse and worse by the way the mailers make really good can link in your fireplace they light up fast but you know were at a stage where the silliness where the washington game where the distortions they dont matter this campaign i believe will be decided friend of friend neighbor to neighbor pastor pastor one i want to another and so what i asked if each of you is that you very directly reach out and win this race together the third and final thing i want to ask if everyone is that you pray that you commit for the next nine days each and every day to lift this country up in prayer that you spent just one minute today in the morning when you get up when youre shaving when youre having lunch when youre putting your kids down to sleep when youre lying down in bed you spent just one minute please continue this awakening continue this spirit of revival awaken the body of christ that we might pull back from this abyss i will tell you it is a powerful thing to look at the comp assailed by george washington did not know glenn was going to give this to me loan it to me it is an amazing reminder of what the stakes are that when this country has faced extraordinary threats in the past that the american people have risen up against and were here today standing on the promises of second chronicles if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear their prayer and forgive their sins and i will heal their land let me tell you a bit of history at her friends in the mainstream media will never tell you in january when ronald reagan took the oath of office his left hand was resting on nd chronicles a very real and concrete manifestation of that promise from the word of god this nation has faced extraordinary threats before we hit faced the abyss before and every time with gods blessing it hasnt been one individual it hasnt been one candidate it has been the american people we the people that have risen up and pulled this country back from the abyss we have done it before and we can do it againan option on a set of the men and women here thank you for sending to washington a strong christian conservative leader like senator tim scott feel like its sunday morning we have a call to worship on the steps the word tells us when two or more again saturday at his name he will be there where there are a whole lot more than two of us here today and outside our nation is in crisis but i want to tell you there is a revival that is sweeping south carolina that is sweeping the country americans are waking up i wanna talk to you today about three things id like marriage lets start with life weve seen in recent weeks these horrific videos of planned parenthood me tell you right now innocent life should not be treated as a business transaction the body parts of unborn children i call upon every citizen to south carolina every american watch these videos even if especially if you call yourselves prochoice watch these videos planned parenthood officials coldly callously selling the body parts and laughing about yourself on those videos they are confessing to multiple felonies it is a felony with the tenyear to sell body parts and ill tell you something right now if an elected president on the first day in office i will instruct the department of justice to open an investigation in the plan over defunding planned and theyre all continues to go to plan to take part in a conference call that reached down and included over a hundred thousand pastors across this country let me say to the past year the faith leaders who were here stand up and reach the congregation we need leaders noshow stand up and lead and defund planned parenthood today and then talk about marriage just a couple of months ago we saw the uss supreme court issue a decision a fundamentally illegitimate law the marriage laws of every state let me tell you something marriage existed long before the united states supreme court of the united states of america marriage was not ordain ninety law and by god has no jurisdiction over the break it in the united states senate on the constitutional amendment to protect the authority of the state legislatures of every state in the union to define marriage as the union of one man and stripping the federal courts have jurisdiction over attacks on there and ill make a promise to you if elected president every justice i point to the united states supreme court will follow the law and follow the constitution and not impose their radical views on the people of america and burn about religious liberty before i was in the center was the solicitor general of texas the chief lawyer for the state in front of the united states supreme court we defended the ten commandments monument that stands in the state capitol grounds we went to the united states supreme court defending the ten commandments and we won we defended the pledge of allegiance the words one nation under god we went to the united states supreme court and we won represented over three million veterans defending the cross erected to honor the men and women in ww arguing the image of a cross on public lands the federal district court agreed the federal court of appeal not tell you one thing they were right about there is power in the image of a cross and yet i was proud to represent over three million veterans before the uss supreme court defending the mojave desert veterans memorial and we want as tony told you just last week we hosted a rally in iowa over people came together in support of religious liberty and we brought to the stage who told their story of standing for faith in me in person people like a wonderful couple told an old historic lutheran church when they hosted way until to maintain and demanded that they host and celebrate their homosexual guarded about mennonites they said very respectfully very kindly they could not host and celebrate that contrary to their face and the old guard were soon they were persecuted they paid a fine and they have now gone out of the wedding business shut down their business and laid off all of their employees we listen to people like atlantas fire chief cochran an africanamerican grew up in a challenge neighborhood grew up struggling but he wanted to be a major city in america but chief cochran is also a sunday school teacher he wrote a book about scripture he wrote a book in his personal time about his faith in what the bible teaches us and they fire chief for daring to write a book repeating what scripture teaches this is the world where your faith is next who preaches the word from the pulpit next maybe your sister or brother center and you wanna know how bad it can get it at the wife of pastor site an american citizen to eight years in prison in iran for the crime preaching the gospel an amazing thing we all together we pray for pastor side our president is abandoned pastor saeed and three other hostages in iran we pray for pastor side but let me tell you is always in control earthquake broke the power to free pass but ill tell you now may share that even in the bowels of hell hole of an iranian prison if you go to our website ted cruz died or watch these stories watch these stories and youll be uplifting you will be inspired heroes at patriot who stand and risked persecution from all of us here we understand that its not an abstract concept its real and personal in our lives i think about when i was a little boy my parents are not christians in the time and they were both alcoholics they drank far too much and when i was three years old my dad left he flew to houston he said i dont want to be a husband anymore i dont want to be a day to my threeyearold son and a friend and business colleague in houston invited him to a bible study and at that bible study fell to his knees and he gave his life to jesus and my father proceeded to drive to the airport and plane ticket and fly back to my mother and me to be a husband and father so when people ask is a i can tell you that have been raised by a single mom without were it not for the transformational redemptive love and do we live in a country where like this under a software marriage is under assault with faith is under assault the last election fiftyfour million evangelical christian state is it any wonder we have the country honoring the commands of the scripture we are told to be so you can come into contact with you if youre told or believe we will stay home no convictions thats right and transform this nation and i will tell you this we are here today despite all of these challenges sometimes things get really bad to wake people up there is a spirit of revival in awakening sweeping this country and i will tell you we are on the steps of the capitol today claiming the promise that second chance and see from there then i will hear their prayers and i will the united stateswe are at now andgood to see you thank you thank you so much president falwell god bless liberty university i am thrilled to join you today at the largest christian university in the world today i want to talk with you about the promise of america imagine your parents when they were children imagine a little girl growing up in wilmington delaware during world war ii the daughter of irish and italian catholic family working class her uncle ran numbers in wilmington she grew up with dozens of cousins because her mom was the second youngest of kids she had a difficult father a man who drank far too much and frankly didn’t think that women should be educated and yet this young girl pretty and shy was driven was bright was inquisitive and she became the first person in her family ever to go to college in my mom eleanor graduated from rice university with a degree in math and became a pioneering computer programmer in the s and s imagine a teenage boy not much younger than many of you here today growing up in cuba jet black hair skinny as a rail involved in student council and yet cuba was not at a peaceful time the dictator batista was corrupt he was oppressive and this teenage boy joins a revolution he joins a revolution against batista he begins fighting with other teenagers to free cuba from the dictator this boy at age finds himself thrown in prison finds himself tortured beaten and then at age he flees cuba he comes to america imagine for a second the hope that was in his heart as he rode that ferry boat across to key west and got on a greyhound bus to head to austin texas to begin working washing dishes making cents an hour coming to the one land on earth that has welcomed so many millions when my dad came to america in he could not have imagined what lay in store for him imagine a young married couple living together in the s neither one of them has a personal relationship with jesus they have a little boy and they are both drinking far too much they are living a fast life when i was three my father decided to leave my mother and me we were living in calgary at the time he got on a plane and he flew back to texas and he decided he didn’t want to be married anymore and he didn’t want to be a father to his yearold son and yet when he was in houston a friend a colleague from the oil and gas business invited him to a bible study invited him to clay road ph baptist church and there my father gave his life to jesus christ and god transformed his heart and he drove to the airport he bough a plane ticket and he flew back to be with my mother and me there are people who wonder if faith is real i can tell you in my family there’s not a second of doubt because were it not for the transformative love of jesus christ i would have been saved and i would have been raised by a single mom without my father in the household imagine another little girl living in africa in kenya and nigeria that’s a diverse crowd playing with kids they spoke swahili she spoke english coming back to california where her parents who had been missionaries in africa raised her on the central coast she starts a small business when she’s in grade school baking bread she calls it heidi’s bakery she and her brother compete baking bread they bake thousands of loaves of bread and go to the local apple orchard where they sell the bread to people coming to pick apples she goes on to a career in business excelling and rising to the highest pinnacles and then heidi becomes my wife and my very best friend in the world heidi becomes an incredible mom to our two precious little girls caroline and catherine the joys and loves of our life imagine another teenage boy being raised in houston hearing stories from his dad about prison and torture in cuba hearing stories about how fragile liberty is beginning to study the united states constitution learning about the incredible protections we have in this country that protect the godgiven liberty of every american experiencing challenges at home in the s oil prices crater and his parents business go bankrupt heading off to school over a thousand miles away from home in a place where he knew nobody where he was alone and scared and his parents going through bankruptcy meant there was no financial support at home so at the age of he went to get two jobs to help pay his way through school he took over in school loans loans i suspect a lot of ya’ll can relate to loans that i’ll point out i just paid off a few years ago these are all of our stories these are who we are as americans and yet for so many americans the promise of america seems more and more distant what is the promise of america the idea that the revolutionary idea that this country was founded upon which is that our rights don’t come from man they come from god almighty and that the purpose of the constitution as thomas jefferson put it is to serve as chains to bind the mischief of government the incredible opportunity of the american dream what has enabled millions of people from all over the world to come to america with nothing and to achieve anything and then the american exceptionalism that has made this nation a clarion voice for freedom in the world a shining city on a hill that’s the promise of america that is what makes this nation an indispensable nation a unique nation in the history of the world and yet so many fear that that promise is today unattainable so many fear it is slipping away from our hands i want to talk to you this morning about reigniting the promise of america years ago on this very day a yearold lawyer named patrick henry stood up just a hundred miles from here in richmond virginia and said “give me liberty or give me death” applause i want to ask each of you to imagine imagine millions of courageous conservatives all across america rising up together to say in unison “we demand our liberty” today roughly half of born again christians aren’t voting they’re staying home imagine instead millions of people of faith all across america coming out to the polls and voting our values today millions of young people are scared worried about the future worried about what the future will hold imagine millions of young people coming together and standing together saying “we will stand for liberty” think just how different the world would be imagine instead of economic stagnation booming economic growth instead of small businesses going out of business in record numbers imagine small businesses growing and prospering imagine young people coming out of school with four five six job offers imagine innovation thriving on the internet as government regulators and tax collectors are kept at bay and more and more opportunity is created imagine america finally becoming energy selfsufficient as millions and millions of highpaying jobs are created five years ago today the president signed obamacare into law within hours liberty university went to court filing a lawsuit to stop that failed law instead of the joblessness instead of the millions forced into parttime work instead of the millions who’ve lost their health insurance lost their doctors have faced skyrocketing health insurance premiums imagine in a new president signing legislation repealing every word of obamacare imagine health care reform that keeps government out of the way between you and your doctor and that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable instead of a tax code that crushes innovation that imposes burdens on families struggling to make ends met imagine a simple flat tax that lets every american fill out his or her taxes on a postcard imagine abolishing the irs instead of the lawlessness and the president’s unconstitutional executive amnesty imagine a president that finally finally finally secures the borders and imagine a legal immigration system that welcomes and celebrates those who come to achieve the american dream instead of a federal government that wages an assault on our religious liberty that goes after hobby lobby that goes after the little sisters of the poor that goes after liberty university imagine a federal government that stands for the first amendment rights of every american instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage instead of a government that works to undermine our second amendment rights that seeks to ban our ammunition imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all lawabiding americans instead of a government that seizes your emails and your cell phones imagine a federal government that protected the privacy rights of every american instead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through common core imagine repealing every word of common core imagine embracing school choice as the civil rights issue of the next generation that every single child regardless of race regardless of ethnicity regardless of wealth or zip code every child in america has the right to a quality education and that’s true from all of the above whether is public schools or charter schools or private schools or christian schools or parochial schools or home schools every child instead of a president who boycotts prime minister netanyahu imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of israel instead of a president who seeks to go to the united nations to endrun congress and the american people imagine a president who says “i will honor the constitution and under no circumstances will iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon” imagine a president who says “we will stand up and defeat radical islamic terrorism” “and we will call it by its name” “we will defend the united states of america” now all of these seem difficult indeed to some they may seem unimaginable and yet if you look in the history of our country imagine it’s and you and i were sitting there in richmond listening to patrick henry say give me liberty or give me death imagine it’s and we were watching the signers of the declaration of independence stand together and pledge their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to igniting the promise of america imagine it was and we were watching general washington as he lost battle after battle after battle in the freezing cold as his soldiers with no shoes were dying fighting for freedom against the most powerful army in the world that too seemed unimaginable imagine it’s and we were listening to president franklin delano roosevelt tell america at a time of crushing depression at a time of a gathering storm abroad that we have nothing to fear but fear itself imagine it’s and you and i were listening to ronald reagan and he was telling us that we would cut the top marginal tax rates from percent all the way down to percent that we would go from crushing stagnation to booming economic growth to millions being lifted out of poverty and into prosperity abundance that the very day that he was sworn in our hostages who were languishing in iran would be released and that within a decade we would win the cold war and tear the berlin wall to the ground that would have seemed unimaginable and yet with the grace of god that’s exactly what happened from the dawn of this country at every stage america has enjoyed god’s providential blessing over and over again when we face impossible odds the american people rose to the challenge you know compared to that repealing obamacare and abolishing the irs ain’t all that tough the power of the american people when we rise up and stand for liberty knows no bounds if you’re ready to join a grassroots army across this nation coming together and standing for liberty i’m going to ask you to break a rule here today and to take out your cell phones and to text the word constitution to the number you can also text imagine we’re versatile once again text constitution to god’s blessing has been on america from the very beginning of this nation and i believe god isn’t done with america yet i believe in you i believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of america and that is why today i am announcing that i’m running for president of the united states it is a time for truth it is a time for liberty it is a time to reclaim the constitution of the united states i am honored to stand with each and every one of you courageous conservatives as we come together to reclaim the promise of america to reclaim the mandate the hope and opportunity for our children and our children’s children we stand together for liberty this is our fight the answer will not come from washington it will come only from the men and women across this country from men and women from people of faith from lovers of liberty from people who respect the constitution it will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country when the american people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great we will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the united states of america thank you and god bless youwow! god bless the values voter summit…so i gotta ask what are these things is barack obama coming let me say thank you to my friend jim bridenstine what an incredible powerful fighting conservative there’s an ancient chinese curse “may you live in interesting times” these are interesting times yesterday pope francis was in washington wonderful to welcome him here i have to say the press conference was a little awkward because every time the reporters addressed a question to your holiness barack obama answered[applause laughter] and then today the president of china president xi is in town media all across the world are reporting on this historic meeting of the world’s most powerful communist and the president of china [more applause laughter] how many of y’all have watched the republican debates how fantastic is it that we have such an array of young charismatic talented principled leaders stepping forward to lead this party and this country and what a contrast … with the democrats i’m pretty sure the first democratic debate is going to consist of hillary clinton and the chipotle clerk it is amazing to watch the democrats as they keep moving their debates first it was going to be august then it was going to be september then it was octoberthey may move it to in a few months we may see the first presidential debate in leavenworth if they can project a rainbow on the white house maybe they can put bars on the windows i’ll tell you it’s not widely know they had planned to have an earlier democratic debate the problem was the debate invitation was emailed to hillary i am so honored to be back with so many friends today i want to say my friend tony perkins the family research council does incredible work in this country you want to talk about a strong principled conservative who scares the living daylights out of washington but i have to tell you tony doesn’t scare washington nearly as much as the men and women gathered in this ballroom you want to know how much each of you terrify washington yesterday john boehner was speaker of the house y’all come to town and somehow that changes my only request is can you come more often tony we need to schedule these weekly once a week listen every one of us we know our country is in crisis we know that this isn’t a typical time in politics we’re bankrupting our kids and grandkids our constitutional rights are under assault each and every day from washington as america has receded from leadership in the world it is making the world a much more dangerous place but i want to come to you this morning with a word of hope and encouragement and exhortation –– all across this country the american people are waking up and i’ll tell you today help is on the way i want to ask everyone here to look forward look forward to january if i am elected president let me tell you what i’ll do on the first day in office the first thing i intend to do is rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action the president tells us he has a phone and he has a pen well you live by the pen you die by the pen my pen has got an eraser sadly the corruption’s not been limited to the white house it has extended across every agency of the federal government and the second thing i intend to do on my first day in office is to instruct the department of justice to open an investigation into planned parenthood and these horrible videos and to prosecute any and all criminal conduct by that organization the administration of justice should be blind to party or ideology the only fidelity of the department of justice should be to the laws and the constitution of the united states of america the third thing i intend to do on the first day in office is to instruct the department of justice and the irs and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today! that means that every service man and woman can worship the lord god almighty with all of his heart mind and soul and his commanding officer has nothing to say about it that means the little sisters of the poor who pope francis visited this week will find that the case against them has been dismissed you know kim davis is here just a couple of weeks ago i had the opportunity to visit kim in a kentucky jailhouse now six months a year ago if i had come and said that a christian woman was going to be thrown in jail locked up in jail for living her faith the media would have dismissed me as a nutcase that’s where we are today kim and i embraced and i told her i said ‘kim thank you you are inspiring millions across this country by standing for your faith’ the book of acts tells us that when paul and cyrus were in jail that god brought an earthquake and broke open the jail cell what i told kim is that you are being lifted up in prayer by millions of believers across america and across the world you may have thought you were alone in that jail cell but you didn’t understand how crowded it was and i’ll tell you kim’s very simple response she smiled and pointed up and said ‘to god be the glory’ the fourth thing i intend to do on the first day in office is to rip to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal the single greatest national security threat facing america is the threat of a nuclear iran i gotta tell you i can’t wait to stand on a debate stage next to hillary clinton and to make very clear to the american people if you vote for hillary clinton you are voting for iran to acquire nuclear weapons if you vote for me under no circumstances will a nation led by a theocratic ayatollah who chants ‘death to america’ under no circumstances will iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons if the ayatollah doesn’t understand that we may have to introduce him to his seventytwo virgins the fifth thing i intend to do on the first day of office is begin the process of moving the american embassy in israel to jerusalem the eternal capital of jerusalem that’s day one! there are days in a year four years in a presidential term four years in a second term by the end of eight years this ballroom is going to be a whole lot bigger by the end of eight years there’s going to be a whole of reporters and journalists who check themselves into therapy in the days that follow i will go to congress and we will repeal every word of obamacare in the days that follow i will instruct the federal department of education which should be abolished that common core ends today in the days that follow we will honor our military we will honor the commitments made to our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and we will protect our service members right to keep and bear arms and defend themselves that means the next time a jihadist walks into a recruiting center in chattanooga tennessee he’s going to encounter the business end of firearms wielded by a dozen marines in the days that follow we finally finally finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities we will stop the indefensible practice of releasing violent criminal illegal aliens we will pass kate’s law in the days that follow we will take on the epa and the cfpb [consumer financial protection bureau] and the alphabet soup of government agencies that strangle small businesses and we will unleash booming economic growth in the days that follow i will go to congress and we will pass fundamental tax reform and we will pass a simple flat tax where every american can fill out his or her taxes on post card when we do that we should abolish the irs some of you may be thinking that makes common sense to me live within your means don’t bankrupt our kids and grandkids follow the constitution but can we do it can it be done scripture tells us there is nothing new under the sun i think where we are today is very very much like the late s same failed economic policies same misery stagnation and malaise the same feckless and naive foreign policies in fact the exact same countries russia and iran openly laughing at and mocking the president of the united states why is it that analogy gives me so much hope and optimism because we know how that story ended all across this country millions of men and women rose up and became the reagan revolution it didn’t come from washington washington despised ronald reagan by the way if you see a candidate that washington embraces run and hide it turned this country around and i’m here to tell you the same thing is happening again all over this country millions of men and women are waking up do you know that since this campaign has started out of seventeen republican candidates you know which campaign raised the most hard money we did! to date over contributions people all over the country coming to tedcruzorg tedcruzorg tedcruzorg the people are waking up let me tell you what washington wants washington wants us divided washington wants conservatives split a chunk of evangelicals here a chunk of conservatives over here a chunk of libertarians over here a chunk of tea party folks over here that’s how if we are splintered that a moderate establishment candidate runs up the middle with percent of the vote steals the nomination and then loses to hillary clinton in the general election you know what we’ve seen that movie before i’m not interested in going to see rocky we have a simple task before us if conservatives unit we win i’m here to ask each and every one of you to stand stand in your faith stand in your principles come together how do we turn this country around just like in we rise up as we the people and we say ‘we will defend this last best hope for mankind this shining city on a hill that is the united states of america’today there is no greater threat to us national security than the prospect of a nuclear iran led by theocratic zealots who have pledged to “annihilate israel” and who regularly lead chants of “death to america” an iran with nuclear weapons poses an unacceptably high risk of murdering millions of americans or millions of our allies for that reason the top priority for the senate should be to stop a bad iran deal the senate is now considering the iran nuclear review agreement act corkercardin which provides that any iran deal must be submitted to congress this legislation started out with good intentions and i supported moving it forward in committee indeed i support anything that slows down the obama administration’s headlong rush into finalizing an iran deal that jeopardizes us national security on the floor of the senate however i intend to press vigorously for a critical amendment to this legislation at the end of the debate if this bill is not strengthened i will have a great deal of difficulty supporting it right now the president has statutory authority to relax some iran sanctions and he has the constitutional authority to try to negotiate with foreign nations any deal he desires yet we must remember that in order for any foreign deal to become binding us law there are two and only two paths under our constitution first he can submit his proposal as a treaty to the senate which requires votes for ratification or second he can submit it as legislation get a majority vote in both houses of congress and then sign it into law president obama chafes at these constitutional requirements the current iran deal is so bad on the merits that he knows that it cannot meet either threshold hence the administration has suggested it wants to circumvent congress perhaps by trying to go the united nations for ratification but the un likewise lacks the authority to create binding us law if it is not codified in a treaty or a statute a un resolution cannot bind the next president so what does corkercardin do it requires the president to submit an iran deal to congress and then it provides that congress can pass a “resolution of disapproval” to kill the deal any such resolution would be subject to a possible democratic filibuster which would take votes to overcome and even if both houses were to pass a resolution of disapproval president obama could veto it which would then require twothirds of the house and twothirds of the senate to override if those supermajorities cannot be mustered the president’s bad iran deal would go into effect thus corkercardin motion of disapproval reverses the ordinary presumptions instead of the president needing senate votes to ratify the iran deal it would now require votes to stop an iran deal this makes no sense why is the current legislation so weak because the price of getting support from democratic senators has been to water down the legislation to the point where it is almost entirely meaningless as written the legislation would do two things first it would provide democratic senators with a show vote to say they were tough on iran before tacitly approving it second it would virtually ensure that president obama’s bad iran deal—which endangers the lives of millions of americans—stands president obama’s proposed deal makes military conflict with iran a virtual certainty under the terms that have been publicly announced iran will keep its nuclear centrifuges will keep its enriched uranium and will keep developing its icbm program which exists for the sole purpose of carrying a nuclear weapon to america under the terms of the deal iran will receive billions of dollars — which it will surely use to keep developing nuclear weapons and because iran will remain the leading state sponsor of terrorism the deal does nothing to change that those billions of dollars will also be funneled directly to hezbollah and hamas and radical islamic terrorists across the world along with sen pat toomey i have introduced an amendment to switch the presumption of power back where it belongs to congress if the president cannot secure either a majority in both houses no sanctions relief should be implemented without this amendment corkercardin will likely do more harm than good—simply providing political cover for a bad iran deal which is why the obama administration is now supportive of the legislation president obama is fond of posing a false dichotomy either you support his current iran deal or you want war but as israel‘s prime minister benjamin netanyahu rightly observed “a bad deal is worse than no deal” as it stands corkercardin is a bad deal that paves the way for the president’s worse deal with iran in january we will have a new president he or she will likely encounter an iran on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons if president obama has implemented his bad deal—if he has unraveled the international consensus in favor of strict sanctions on iran—then sanctions will in all likelihood be impossible to reimpose doing so would take months or years if at all probably too far out to prevent a nuclear iran thus the next president would be left with two choices acquiesce to iran having nuclear weapons which it could then use to murder americans and our allies or launch a targeted military attack to destroy iran’s nuclear capacity the obama deal makes those the only two realistic options in that’s why the senate should stop it peace through strength is the only way both to avoid war and to prevent a nuclear iran and that is why we need iran sanctions legislation with teetha year ago today the iraqi city of mosul fell to islamic state militants an event that should have shattered any lingering illusions that islamic state was the jv of radical islamic terrorist groups for the past months we have seen its vicious campaign to establish a new caliphate carved out of syria and iraq play out on computer and television screens across the globe we have seen american israeli british and japanese captives beheaded we have seen a brave jordanian pilot burned alive we have seen mass executions of egyptian christians we have seen the civilian populations of syria and iraq brutalized with woman and children crucified raped tortured and forced to accept the sharia law imposed by the islamic state while these atrocities have grabbed the headlines islamic state has also been engaged in a steady campaign of territorial expansion both in the region and beyond other major iraqi cities including fallujah and ramadi have fallen to the islamic state it has extended its operations to libya and allied with boko haram in nigeria socalled lone wolf plots to attack us here at home have cropped up from texas to massachusetts just this week the islamic state has captured dozens of eritrean christians in libya and announced its intention to conquer the iraqi capital of baghdad a threat that may be more sensational than real but which demonstrates its broadening ambitions even more disturbingly reports are surfacing that the islamic state may be working on chlorinebased chemical weapons and even a crude dirty bomb fashioned out of the radioactive material seized from iraqi medical facilities even so islamic state is not yet invincible and we should not fall into the trap of thinking it cannot be defeated determined efforts against it have proved effective for example at tikrit in iraq and kobani in syria but tikrit was captured by the iranbacked shiite militias some of whom have proven almost as vicious as the islamic state kobani was defended by the kurdish peshmerga forces not the iraqi security forces isf and these defeats have proven isolated events while the larger momentum has been in islamic states favor its time to tell the american people the truth one year into the program we must admit that the obama administration strategy which has consisted of a limited us air campaign a program to train and equip the isf and a directive to achieve sectarian political reconciliation in baghdad is failing unfortunately the administration cannot see this simple truth while the president did admit this week that his strategy is imperfect and lacking in details his solution appears to be more of the same as he recommended more trainers and made increasingly desperate pleas to baghdad to fill in the blanks enough we cant afford another year of deliberation and halfhearted measures that will only further embolden islamic state and tip it toward victory what we have been doing isnt working and doubling down on a failed strategy will not result in success there are still choices besides continuing president obamas botched strategy or redeploying tens of thousands of american combat troops to iraq for starters we have to stop understanding the mission against the islamic state as an extension of the invasion to topple saddam hussein which then mushroomed into an effort to turn iraq into a westernstyle democracy our mission now should be to destroy the islamic state terrorists whose avowed purpose is to harm america and our allies not to turn iraq into a democratic utopia given the dysfunctional state of iraq we also need to let go of the fantasy that the isf is going to be our boots on the ground the fact is as pentagon spokesman col steve warren admitted this week that we simply do not have the requisite number of iraqi recruits to make this strategy effective it doesnt matter how many trainers we send if there is no one there for them to train the goal of political reconciliation in baghdad which the administration has also prioritized has proven equally illusory we are marking another unhappy anniversary this month—the anniversary of haider alabadi becoming prime minister of iraq while shia there were hopes among the sunni arab nations such as egypt and jordan that mr alabadi would reverse the disastrous sectarian policies of his predecessor nouri almalaki and bring iraq together to fight the existential threat of the islamic state however well intentioned he may be however mr alabadi has not been able to perform this miracle surrounded by entrenched almaliki loyalists he has taken no significant actions to reduce the militant shiite influence of iran or to liberate the sunni territory invaded by islamic state absent a dramatic shift in the prime ministers policies — something that would have to come from within his administration and cannot be imposed by the us — making political reconciliation in baghdad a keystone of our strategy dooms it from the getgo it is time to shake free of the failures of the past year and engage in some fresh thinking in last weekends washington post retired air force lt gen david deptula proposed an alternative strategy which would consist of exploiting our asymmetric advantage over the islamic state through an overwhelming air campaign unfettered from the rigid and restrictive targeting rules ostensibly designed to protect civilians but which have effectively enabled islamic state to continue oppressing them the recent election in turkey a rebuke to the antiamerican president tayyip erdogan who has refused us access to the nato air base at incirlik might present an opportunity for us to press for use of this vital asset we might also look into bypassing baghdad to arm the kurds directly to ensure the free flow of ammunition and heavy weapons and then embed our special operations troops with them to provide the targeting intelligence our air campaign requires the kurds have proven their value in battle against islamic state and we should allow them to help us while providing them the assistance they need for our allies such as israel jordan and egypt such actions would be a welcome demonstration of decisive and engaged american leadership the united states is blessed with the greatest fighting force in the history of the planet and the destruction of the islamic state is not beyond our capability especially when we work with our effective regional partners but if we hope to get the job done before it is too late we must make clear that that is of our missionover the last week the world has once again looked on aghast as president vladimir putin has taken violent advantage of regional instability to reestablish russias influence this time in the middle east despite promises to join the united states in a counterterrorism effort against isis in iraq and syria putin is on a mission to protect russian assets in the mediterranean by propping up his client syrian president bashar alassad meanwhile the obama administration has been caught flatfooted as putins actions threaten to inflame and destabilize an already acute crisis enough already we dont need a reset we need a reality check putin has been unmoved by the obama administrations threats of isolation on the international stage and economic sanctions have on their own been no deterrent to his opportunistic behavior more of the same will not result in success we need a coherent plan to address both the specific crisis in syria and the challenge posed more broadly by putins resurgent russia the good news is that america still has options if our leaders can summon the will to exercise them for starters in syria we cant double down on the failed strategies that have given putin his opportunity to intervene we are now two years out from president obamas proposed intervention after alassad used chemical weapons against his own people some of my senate colleagues vocally supported the administrations plan to strike alassad others opposed on principle intervention of any sort in syria while i understood how important it was for obama to enforce his own red line i was skeptical of the proposal on the grounds that i did not think a pinprick strike that was unbelievably small and designed to enforce international norms would effectively further americas national security interests as it turned out the president rescinded his request to congress to authorize military force against assad he instead opted to partner with putin in an effort to remove chemical weapons from syria an arrangement that gave the russian strongman his first toehold in the region we are now more than a year and more than billion into obamas military effort against isis which has been a failure despite the exemplary bravery and professionalism of our men and women in uniform they are being deployed to execute a strategy so opaque and confused under rules of engagement so restrictive that there can be no hope for victory the million training and equipping of the syrian moderate opposition that obama and his supporters have insisted would provide a viable alternative to alassad has utterly collapsed with a pitifully small handful of fighters either defecting dead or swept aside by putins airstrikes meanwhile the government of iraq remains paralyzed by sectarian conflict and increasingly under the sway of tehran and as such unable to muster an effective offensive against isis despite a steady stream of american support in the form of regular supplies of arms and thousands of ground troops if we want to actually dismantle isis we need to dramatically change course we need a real robust campaign that maximizes our overwhelming air advantage we need to focus our efforts not on trying to create friends but on supporting our real ones especially the kurds in iraq and syria who have actually had success against isis and rather than pouring more resources into a dysfunctional baghdad we should extend consistent robust assistance to our regional allies israel egypt and jordan who are on the front lines of this fight these actions would demonstrate real american resolve to dismantle isis without entangling us in some sort of devils bargain with alassad or the iranians and they would demonstrate to putin that we will not allow him to move unimpeded into the region to advance an agenda that is contrary to our own there is also the larger issue of how we will confront a russia that has been emboldened by six and a half years of american weakness but we know perfectly well how to reverse this situation putin himself has told us what he fears the most according to his september oped in the new york times it is american exceptionalism it is dangerous to dictators like putin when americans remember their exceptionalism the unique combination of power and principle that has made the united states the greatest force for good on the planet has historically posed a grave threat to repressive bullies we have a successful model in front of us of how to deal with russia without creating a diplomatic crisis we can emulate the decisive actions that empowered ronald reagan to win the cold war without firing a shot we can highlight human rights and aggressively expand and enforce the magnitsky act which targets russian officials accused of human rights abuses we can redouble our efforts to develop the defensive weapons that neutralized the offensive soviet threat particularly missile defense which has seen a budget reduction under obama according to an analysis from the conservative heritage foundation and has been constrained by bad arms deals like new start we should not only move quickly to install the canceled interceptor sites putin opposed in poland and the czech republic but also to develop the next generation of systems that will only increase his discomfiture these options do not entail a ground war in syria yet would effectively shake us free from the failed policies that have brought us to our current impasse these options set us on a new path that puts putin on notice that the united states is reclaiming our traditional role as leader of the free worldyesterday delivered a powerful speech on the senate floor highlighting the many examples of republican leadership surrendering to president obama’s demands including funding plannedparenthood and the catastrophic iran nuclear deal and reminding the republican party’s capitol hill leadership to keep their promises to the american people senator cruz’s speech followed his attempt to obtain a vote on his amendment to end taxpayer funding of planned parenthood and the iranian nuclear deal his colleagues refused to allow him the courtesy of a rollcall vote on his motion which would have allowed for consideration of his amendment senator cruz’s floor speech was so powerful we’ve decided to present it in its entirety below the text of senator cruz’s amendment can be found here video of the speech can be viewed through this link remarks of senator ted cruz september “mr president there is a reason the american people are fed up with washington there is a reason the american people are frustrated the frustration is not simply mild or passing or ephemeral it is volcanic over and over again the american people go to the ballot box over and over again the american people rise up and say the direction were going doesnt make sense we want change over and over again the american people win elections in a tidal wave election in a tidal wave election and yet nothing changes in washington “mr president id like to share with you and the american people the real story of what is happening in washington why is it that our leaders cannot stop bankrupting this country cannot stop the assault on our constitutional rights cannot stop americas retreat from leadership in the world its a very simple dynamic when you have two sides allegedly in a political battle one side that is relentlessly unshakably committed to its principles and the other side that reflexively surrenders at the outset the outcome is fore other detained “i will give president obama and the senate democrats credit they believe in principles of big government they believe in this relentless assault on our constitutional rights and they are willing to crawl over broken glass with a knife between their teeth to fight for those principles unfortunately leadership on my side of the aisle does not demonstrate the same commitment to principles now how is it you might wonder that a preemptive surrender is put in place well it all begins with the relatively innocuous statement there shall be no shutdowns that is a statement leadership in both houses republican leadership in both houses has said ‘were not going to shut the government down’ you could understand the folks in the private sector folks at home – that sounds perfectly reasonable except heres the reality in washington “in todays washington there are three kinds of votes there are number one show votes show votes show votes votes that are brought up largely to placate the voters where the outcome is fore other detained where most republicans will vote one way democrats will vote the other republicans will lose and the conservatives who elected republican majorities in both houses are supposed to be thrilled that they have been patted on the head and given their show vote that was destined to lose we had a vote like that in recent weeks on planned parenthood leadership told us ‘you should be thrilled we voted on it what else do you want’ we voted on it in a context where it would never happen and indeed it didnt the second kind of vote are votes that simply grow government that dramatically expend spending expand corporate welfare and those votes mr president those votes passed because you get a bipartisan coalition of republican leadership and democrat both of whom are convinced that career politicians will get reelected if they keep growing and growing government and in particular handing out corporate welfare to giant corporations oh boy if you have got the lobbyists on k street pushing for something you can get votes in this chamber because republican leadership loves it and democrats are always willing to grow government “and then theres a third kind of vote votes on mustpass legislation in an era when one side the democratic party is adamantly committed to continuing down this path that is causing so many millions of americans to hurt mustpass votes are the only votes that have real consequence in this chamber they typically fall into one of three categories – either continuing resolution or an omnibus appropriation bill or a debt ceiling increase each of those three are deemed mustpass votes and if you actually want to change law those are the only hopes of doing so but i mentioned before you have got one side that has preemptively surrendered republican leadership has said ‘we will never ever ever shut down the government’ and suddenly president obama understands the easy key to winning every battle he simply has to utter the word ‘shutdown’ and republican leadership runs to the hills “so president obama demands of congress fund every bit of obamacare percent of it and do nothing zero for the millions of americans who are hurting millions of americans who have lost their jobs who have lost their health care who have lost their doctors who have been worsted into parttime work millions of young people who have seen their premiums skyrocket president obama says you can do nothing for the people that are hurting senate democrats say ‘we dont care about the people who are hurting well do nothing for them’ and heres the kicker president obama promises ‘if you try to do anything on obamacare i barack obama will veto funding for the entire federal government and shut it down’ and republican leadership compliantly says ‘okay fine well fund obamacare’ “president obama then – understanding hes got a pretty good trump card here he can pull out any time – next he says ‘okay republicans fund my unconstitutional executive amnesty its contrary to law its flouting federal immigration law but you republicans fund it anyway or else i barack obama will veto funding for the entire federal government and shut it down’ and republican leadership says at the outset ‘okay well fund amnesty’ “and now you turn to planned parenthood barack obama this will surprise no one says ‘fund percent of planned parenthood with taxpayer money’ mind you planned parenthood is a private organization its not even part of the government but it happens to be politically favored by president obama and the democrats planned parenthood is also the subject of multiple criminal investigations for being caught on tape apparently carrying out a pattern of ongoing felonies in ordinary times the proposition that we should not be sending your and my father’s taxpayer money to fund a private organization under multiple criminal investigations that ought to be a vote but i mentioned before barack obama is absolutely committed to his partisan objectives he is like the terminator he never stops he never gives up he moves forward and forward and forward so what does he say ‘if you dont fund this one private organization thats not part of the government thats under multiple criminal investigations i barack obama will veto funding for the entire federal government and shut it down’ and what does republican leadership say well it will surprise no one republican leadership says ‘we surrender we will fund planned parenthood’ “you know president obama has negotiated a catastrophic nuclear deal with iran republican leadership goes on television all the time and rightly says this is a catastrophic deal the consequences are that its the single greatest national security threat to america millions of americans could die mr president i would suggest if we actually believed the words that are coming out of our mouths then we would be willing to use any and all constitutional authorities given to congress to stop a catastrophic deal that sends over billion to the ayatollah khamenei but yet president obama says he will veto the entire budget if we do and to the surprise of nobody republican leadership surrenders “you know i will draw an analogy mr president its as if in a football game at the beginning of the football game the two team captains go out to flip the coin and one teams coach walks out and says we forfeit and they do it game after game after game right at the coin flip leadership says ‘we forfeit we surrender we republicans will fund every single biggovernment liberal priority of the democrats’ now if a team did that if an nfl team did that over games we know what their record would be it would be and you know i would be pretty sure that the fans who bought tickets who went to the game would be pretty ticked off as they watched their coach forfeit over and over and over and over again “you want to understand the volcanic frustration with washington its that the republican leadership in both houses will not fight for a single priority that we promised the voters we would fight for when we were campaigning less than a year ago “you know this past week was a big news week in washington the speaker of the house john boehner announced he was going to resign there was lots of speculation around the media as to why the speaker of the house resigned mr president im going to tell you why he resigned its actually a direct manifestation of this disconnect between the voters back home and republican leadership speaker boehner and leader mcconnell had promised there will be no shutdown so therefore they will fund every single priority of barack obamas we are right now voting on whats called a clean cr i will note it is clean only in the parlance of washington because what does it do it funds percent of obamacare percent of executive amnesty it funds all of planned parenthood it funds the iranian nuclear deal it is essentially a blank check to obama barack that is not very clean to me that actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill funding priorities that are doing enormous damage “now in the senate the votes were always there for a dirty cr a cr that funded all of barack obamas priorities the democrats will all vote for it heck of course they will theyve got the other side funding their priorities of course every democrat will vote for that over and over and over again and twice on sunday and the simple reality on the republican side is when leadership joins with the democrats about half of the republican caucus is happy to move over to that side of the aisle so the votes were always preordained “the motion i made just a moment ago was a motion to table the tree you remember filling the tree it’s something we heard about a lot in the previous congress harry reid the democratic leader did it all the time senators on this side of the aisle stood up over and over again and said its an abuse of process in fact we even campaigned our leadership saying were going to have an open amendment process yet whats happened here is majority leader mcconnell has taken a page out of leader reids playbook and filled the tree i moved to table the tree and what you then saw was leadership denying a second and what does denying a second mean denying a recorded vote why is that important mr president when you are breaking the commitments youve made to the men and women who elected you the most painful thing in the world is accountability when you are misleading the men and women who showed up to vote for you you dont want sunshine making clear that you voted no a recorded vote means each senators name is on it now why did i move to table the tree simply to add the amendment that i had added which would have number one said not one penny goes to planned parenthood and number two not one penny goes to implementing this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal unless and until they comply with federal law the administration complies with federal law and hands over the full deal including the side agreements with iran what you saw was republican leadership desperately does not want a vote on that “well mr president i intend tomorrow to make that motion again and when i make that motion again i would encourage those watching to see which senators are here to give a second or not and to vote yea or nay i would note by the way when you deny a second which is truly an unprecedented procedural trick it used to be that was a courtesy that was afforded to all senators indeed in the opposing party routinely over and over again when someone asked for a second everyone raises their hand but leadership discovered we can do this in the dark of night but i encourage those watching to see number one when this motion is offered again who shows up to offer a second and who either doesnt raise his hand or just doesnt come to the floor one of the ways you avoid accountability is you somehow are somewhere else doing something really really important instead of actually showing up to the battle that is waging right here and now “but i would also encourage people to watch very carefully what happens after that after that you have a voice vote a voice vote is still a vote lets be clear standing here on the floor there were two senators senator lee and i who voted aye who voted to table the tree and take up the amendment barring funding for planned parenthood and barring funds for this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal the remaining senators on the republican side you had leader mcconnell you had whip cornyn you had senator alexander you had senator cochran those four senators voted loudly no it’s still a vote even thought it’s not a recorded vote its a vote on the senate floor “so why did speaker boehner resign i mentioned to you that the votes were always cooked here the democrats plus republican leadership and the votes that they bring with them ensure plenty of votes for a dirty cr a cr that funds obamacare that funds amnesty that funds planned parenthood that funds this iranian nuclear deal but the house was always the bulwark “mr president youll remember in when we had a fight over obamacare – you were serving in the house at that time in that fight we never had the votes in the senate actually the senate was under control of the democrats they were going to do anything they could to fund obamacare regardless of the millions of people hurting but the house was bulwark in that house in particular there was a core of or strong principled conservatives who cared deeply about honoring the commitments they made to the men and women who elected them that was always the strength we had in that fight “its been interesting reading some of the press coverage speculating that there would be some magic parliamentary trick that would somehow stop this corrupt deal in the senate there are no magic parliamentary tricks when you have the democrats plus republican leadership and a chunk of the republicans those votes can roll over any parliamentary trick you might use even with the blood moon we just had there are no mystical powers that allow you to roll over that “but in the house we’ve still got that strong conservatives so how is it that speaker boehner and leader mcconnell could promise there will never ever be a shutdown because i believe speaker boehner has decided to cut a deal with leader nancy pelosi the leader of the democrats that this dirty cr thats going to be passed out of the senate is going to go to the house and the speaker is going to take it up on the floor pass it with all the democrats just like leader mcconnell just did and a handful of republicans who will go with republican leadership a very significant percentage of republicans will vote no but here is the problem speaker boehners done that more than once and in this instance there were too many republicans who were tired of seeing their leadership lead the democrats rather than lead the republican party i believe if speaker boehner had done that had passed a dirty cr funding planned parenthood funding this iranian nuclear deal that he would have lost his speakership a member of the house had introduced a motion to vacate the chair because house republicans were fed up with their leader not leading at least not leading their party leading the democratic party so speak boehner faced a conundrum if he does what he and leader mcconnell promised which is fund all of barack obamas priorities he would have lost his job so what did he do he announced hes resigning as speaker and resigning as a member of congress that is unsurprising but it also telegraphs the deal hes just cut its a deal to surrender and join with the democrats notice he said hes going to stay a month hes going to stay a month in order to join with the democrats and fund barack obamas priorities “now lets talk about some of the substantive issues that we ought to be talking about lets start with planned parenthood in the past couple of months a series of videos have come out about planned parenthood to some of the people watching this you may never have seen the videos why is that because the mainstream media has engaged in a virtual media blackout on them nbc cbs abc the last thing they want to do is show these videos if you watch fox news you can see the videos but the mainstream media in the great tradition of pravda wants to make sure the citizenry doesnt see whats in “these videos i would encourage every american republican or democrat regardless of where you fall on the right to life even if and in fact especially if you consider yourself prochoice just watch these videos go online and watch them and ask yourself ‘are these my values is this what i believe’ these videos show senior officials from planned parenthood laughing sipping chardonnay and callously heartlessly selling the body parts of unborn children over and over and over again one senior official is caught on video laughing and saying she hopes she sells enough body parts of unborn children to buy herself a lamborghini again i would suggest just ask yourself ‘are these my values’ “in another video a lab tech describes a little baby boy unborn aborted about two pounds his heart still beating she was instructed to insert scissors under his chin to cut open the face of this little boy and harvest his brain because the brain was valuable planned parenthood could sell the brain this is something out of brave new world this is human beings that little boy had a heart that was still beating had a brain that was being harvested and he had a soul given him by god almighty he was made in the image of god and we are now a nation that harvests the body parts of little baby boys and girls it is the very definition of inhumanity to treat children like agriculture to be grown and killed for their body parts to be sold for profit “now there is a reason that the media and the democrats dont want these videos shown because anyone watching these videos will be horrified but theyre not just horrific they are also prima facie evidence of criminal activity there are multiple federal statutes criminal statutes that planned parenthood appears to be violating perhaps on a daily basis the first and most direct is a prohibition on selling the body parts of unborn children for a profit federal criminal law makes that a felony with up to years jail time now these videos show them very clearly selling body parts they also show them bartering over price theyll argue it wasnt for a profit but you watch these videos you watch the undercover buyer saying how much will you give me for them you see the planned parenthood official saying ‘well how much can i get i dont want to bargain against myself’ on its face thats evidence of bargaining for a profit you want the highest price you can get its not tied to your cost its tied to whatever dollars whatever revenue you can bring in “and planned parenthood is the largest abortion provider in this country as another one of these videos reflects it is a volume business planned parenthood taking the lives of unborn children and then selling them apparently for profit it is also a federal criminal offense to alter the means of an abortion for the purpose of harvesting the organs of the unborn child thats a separate criminal offense on video after video you see planned parenthood officials say ‘what parts would you like we can perform a different abortion depending on what parts you want us to harvest’ on the videos they essentially admit to this crime they are filmed in the act “there is the third criminal offense that provides that you cannot harvest the organs of an unborn child without informed consent from the mother and yet again these videos seem to indicate that planned parenthood treats informed consent as a technicality that is sometimes complied with and sometimes ignored “i will say mr president as an aside ordinarily when a national organization is caught on film committing a pattern of felonies the next steps are predictable the department of justice opens an investigation the fbi shows up and seizes their records everything on those videos suggests those felonies are still occurring today what does it say about the obama justice department that no one on the face of the planet believes theres any chance the justice department would even begin to investigate planned parenthood what does it say about the most lawless partisan department of justice that youve got this group hey its a political ally of the president so thats apparently all that matters if its an ally of the president it doesnt matter that theyre videotaped committing felonies the department of justice will not even look at it “you know im an alumnus of the us department of justice i was an associate deputy attorney general i spent much of my adult life working in law enforcement the department of justice has a long distinguished record of remaining outside of partisan politics of staying above the partisan fray of being blind to party or ideology and simply enforcing the law or the constitution im sorry to say under eric holder and loretta lynch the department of justice has completely besmirched that tradition no one remotely believes that the obama justice department will even begin to investigate this pattern of felonies you dont see democrats suggesting it no one in the media suggests it and by the way if this were a republican administration and the entity that admitted to a pattern of felonies was a private entity that supported republicans you would see on cbs nbc abc an indictment clock every night you would see the anchors saying ‘when will this investigation open when will they be indicted’ instead the media pretends these videos dont exist “in the face of what appears to be a national criminal enterprise were faced here with a much simpler question will we continue to pay for it will we continue to pay for it with your and my tax dollars will we send million a year to a private organization to use to fund this ongoing criminal organization and whats the position of the democrats hear no evil see no evil they do not care what democrat do you see calling for the enforcement of criminal laws against planned parenthood what democrat do you see saying at a minimum ‘lets not send taxpayer money to fund this’ not one not a single democrat stood up and said that “let me ask you mr president what happens if planned parenthood gets indicted because even though the us department of justice under president obama has become little more than a partisan arm of the democratic national committee there are state and local prosecutors that are investigating planned parenthood right now if planned parenthood is indicted do the democrats maintain their wall of silence and say ‘were going to continue to fund them under indictment’ by all indications yes you havent heard a single democrat say well if theyre indicted then well stop “now the response mr president from our leadership is we cant win this fight thats their response they say well we cant win the planned parenthood fight why because we dont have votes because we dont have votes mr president if thats the standard then republican leaderships standard is we will only do whatever harry reid and nancy pelosi approve of thats what it means you want to understand why the american people are frustrated we were told ‘if only we had a republican house of representatives then things would be different’ millions of us rose up in incredible numbers and won an historic tidal wave election mr president you were a youth minister called to ministry and yet you stood up and said my countrys in crisis im going to stand and serve the election was historic and yet very little changed “then we were told ‘okay weve got a house of representatives but the problem is the senate as long as harry reid is majority leader we cant do anything’ over and over again washington gray beards would go on television and in gravelly tones they would go on tv and say ‘you cannot govern with onehalf of onethird of government the house of representatives is not enough but if we had the senate then things would be different the problem is harry reid’ “mr president youll recall during the fight over obamacare a number of members of this body republicans said ‘no no no no no we cant fight on obamacare we have to wait until we have a republican senate to fight’ so the american people obliged in millions of us rose up – the second tidal wave election in a period of four years we won nine senate seats we retired harry reid as majority leader we won the largest majority in the house of representatives since the s its been now over nine months since weve had republican majorities in both houses and i ask you mr president what exactly have those republican majorities accomplished “ill tell you mr president ive asked that question all over the country in town halls ive never been in a town hall where the response spontaneously was not ‘absolutely nothing’ its true in every state ive visited and sadly my response over and over again is you know its worse than that i wish the answer were ‘absolutely nothing’ it would have been better if the republican majorities had done absolutely nothing because what in fact have they done well the very first thing that happened right after that election in november is we came back to washington and republican leadership joined up with harry reid and the democrats and passed a trilliondollar cromnibus bill that was filled with pork and corporate welfare grew government grew the debt then republican leadership took the lead in funding obamacare then republican leadership took the lead in funding executive amnesty then republican leadership took the lead in funding planned parenthood and then astonishingly republican leadership took the lead in confirming loretta lynch as attorney general now i ask you mr president which one of those decisions is one iota different from what would have happened with harry reid and the democrats in charge of this chamber those decisions are identical “and i would note by the way with loretta lynch the republican majority could have defeated that nomination the senate majority leader could have done so and yet she looked at the senate judiciary committee she looked at the senate when asked how she would differ from eric holders justice department the most lawless and partisan justice department wed ever seen she said ‘no way whatsoever’ when asked to point to a single instance in which shed be willing to stand up to president obama to stop his lawlessness to stop his abuse of power she could not identify any circumstance in which she would ever stand up to the president who appointed her attorneys general from both parties have done that for centuries now with eric holder the senate could be forgiven because his lawlessness manifested primarily after he was confirmed with loretta lynch she told us beforehand she looked us in the eyes and said ‘hey im going to do exactly what my predecessor has done’ and republican leadership confirmed her anyway is it any wonder the american people are frustrated out of their minds we keep winning elections and the people we put in office dont do what they said they would do “now some people across the country ask me is republican leadership just not very capable are they not that competent or are they unwilling to fight and mr president its neither theyre actually quite competent and theyre willing to fight the question is what theyre fighting for theres a disconnect right now if you or i go to our home states we go to any gathering of citizens we put up a whiteboard and we ask the citizens in the room give me the top priorities you think republican majorities in congress should be focusing on – we wrote priorities that came from the citizens of oklahoma or the citizens of texas or for that matter the citizens of any of the states – those top priorities at least of them would appear nowhere on leaderships priority list on the other hand if you drive just down the street in washington to k street – k street is the street in washington where the lobbyists primarily reside where their offices are – if you get a gathering of corporate lobbyists that represent giant corporations and you ask them their top priorities the list that comes out will not just bear passing similarity it will be identical to the priorities of republican leadership thats the disconnect you know why were not here fighting on this because not giving taxpayer money to planned parenthood is not among the priorities of the lobbyists on k street so leadership is not interested in doing it thats the disconnect “leadership does know how to fight just a couple of months ago dealing with the exportimport bank we saw leadership in both chambers go to extraordinary lengths herculean procedural steps to try to reauthorize a classic example of corporate welfare hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayerguaranteed loans to giant corporations now for that leadership is incentivized because those corporations hire lobbyists and those lobbyists distribute checks typically by the wheelbarrow and there is no incentive greater in this body than getting reelected and the view of leadership is you get reelected by raking in the cash how do you think weve gotten an trillion national debt because the way you reach bipartisan compromise in this body today in the broken world of washington is you grow and grow and grow government you sit around in a room you say ‘ill spend for your priority your priority your priority your priority another trillion dollars and were done’ “the only people that lose are your children and mine the only people that lose are the next generations who find themselves mired deeper and deeper and deeper in debt i think of my little girls caroline and catherine theyre seven and four if we dont stop what were doing your children and my children will face a debt so crushing they wont be able to spend in the future for the priorities of the future for their needs for their wants for whatever crises come up that the next generation confronts theyll spend their whole lives simply working to pay off the debts racked up by their deadbeat parents and grandparents no generation in history has ever done this to their children or grandchildren our parents didnt do it to us their parents didnt do it to them the reason is the corruption of this town and it boils down to a simple proposition the democrats are willing to do anything to push their priorities and the republicans the leadership is not listening to the men and women who elected us “but its actually an even deeper problem than that on the democratic side the major donors that fund the democratic party they dont despise their base the billionaires who write the giant checks that fund president obama and hillary clinton and the democrats on that side of the aisle they dont despise the radical gay rights movement or the radical environmentalist movement or all of the people that knock on doors and get democrats elected the simple reality is a very large percentage of the republican donors actively despise our base actively despise the men and women who showed up and voted you and me into office i can tell you when you sit down and talk with a new york billionaire republican donor and i have talked with quite a few new york billionaire republican donors california republican donors their questions start out as follows first of all youve got to come out for gay marriage you need to be prochoice and you need to support amnesty thats where the republican donors are you wonder why republicans wont fight on any of these issues because the people writing the checks agree with the democrats “now mind you the people who show up at the polls who elected you and me and who elected this republican majority far too many of the republican donors look down on those voters as a bunch of ignorant hicks and rubes thats why leadership likes show votes it wasnt too long ago when the washington cartel was able to mask it all with a show vote or two and theyd tell the rubes back home ‘see we voted on it we just dont have the votes’ “you know when i was first elected to this body many times i heard more senior senators saying some variation of the following ‘now ted thats what you tell folks back home you dont actually do it’ heres whats changed the voters have gotten more informed they now understand the difference between show votes and a real vote they understand the vote we had a week ago on planned parenthood was designed to lose to placate those silly folks that think we shouldnt be sending taxpayer funds to a criminal organization that is selling the body parts of unborn children but on the actual vote that could change policy leadership has no interest in fighting whatsoever you know in the past couple of weeks one of my colleagues sent me a letter that really embodied the leadership message this letter said ‘explain to me how you get votes to defund planned parenthood if you cant produce votes i wont support it’ mr president if that is our standard then we should all be honest with the men and women who elected us we do not have republican votes in this chamber and there is no realistic prospect of our getting votes any time in the foreseeable future if the standard is unless you get votes republican leadership will support no policy issue then each of us when we run should tell the voters ‘if you vote for me i will support whatever policy agenda harry reid and nancy pelosi decide because thats my standard if i dont have votes’ do you ever recall harry reid and the democrats saying how could we get republican votes no their side is absolutely committed to their principles you dont see them holding back at all if the standard is how do we get votes name one thing that leadership will fight for well the answer i mentioned there are three types of votes they will fight for big government they will fight to grow government they will fight to expand corporate welfare well that can indeed get votes but i have never been to a town hall once where citizens said to me ‘the problem is we dont have enough corporate welfare i need more subsidies for big business’ if percent of the agenda of republican leadership is more subsidies for big business what the heck are you and i doing in the senate in the first place that certainly wasnt why i ran and i know it wasnt why you ran either you dont have to win every fight you dont have to fight every fight but you do have to stand for something “and lets look beyond planned parenthood for a minute lets look to iran of all of the decisions that the obama administration has made there may be none more damaging than this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal if this deal goes through there will be three consequences number one the obama administration will become quite literally the worlds leading financier of radical islamic terrorism now when i said that a couple of months ago president obama got very very upset he said it was ridiculous that i would say such a thing but despite attacking me directly president obama didnt actually endeavor to refute the substance of what id said so lets review the facts fact number one iran is today the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism that fact is undisputed even by this administration fact number two if this deal goes through over billion will go directly to iran to the ayatollah khamenei and fact number three if that happens billions of those dollars will go to hamas to hezbollah to the houthis to radical islamic terrorists across the globe who will use those billions to murder americans to murder israelis and to murder europeans “you know mr president its worth remembering years ago this month the horrific terrorist attack that was carried out on september osama bin laden hated america but he never had billions of dollars he never had billion the ayatollah khamenei hates america every bit as much as osama bin laden did and this administration is giving him control of over billion imagine what bin laden could have done look at the damage he did with terrorists carrying box cutters now imagine that same zealotry with billions of dollars behind it the consequences of this deal could easily be another terrorist attack that dwarfs september in scale that kills far more than the roughly lives that were snuffed out who in their right mind would send over billion to a theocratic zealot who chants ‘death to america’ “a second consequence of this catastrophic deal is that were abandoning four hostages four american hostages in iranian jails pastor saeed abedini is an american citizen his wife naghmeh lives in idaho i’ve visited with naghmeh many times pastor saeed has two little kids who desperately want their daddy to come home pastor saeed was sentenced to eight years in prison for the crime of preaching the gospel just last week was the threeyear anniversary of pastor saeeds imprisonment reports are that he is being horribly mistreated that his health is failing and yet president obama cannot bring himself to utter the words ‘pastor saeed abedini’ a hundred billion to the ayatollah khamenei and pastor saeed abedini remains in prison also in prison is amir hekmati an american marine the president has abandoned also in prison is jason rezaian a washington post reporter i know two of the reporters in the gallery a colleague of yours abandoned by president obama in an iranian prison thrown in jail for doing his job reporting on the news and robert levinson whose whereabouts remain unknown why does the president refuse even to utter their names “the third consequence of this deal is this deal will only accelerate irans acquiring nuclear weapons now the administration claims that the deal will prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons why because they promise not to do it we have learned from iran they break their promises over and over and over again and what we do know is that they will have an extra billion to develop nuclear weapons with now i will say the administration has laughingly suggested well they will use that on infrastructure to rebuild their roads to rebuild their energy industry right now theyre sending vast sums to hamas and hezbollah funding terrorism across the world and they have those same infrastructure needs with another billion you dont think theyre going to funnel an awful lot of it to developing nuclear weapons and i would point out it is not by accident that the ayatollah khamenei refers to israel as the ‘little satan’ and america as the ‘great satan’ this is the one threat on the face of the earth that poses a real possibility of millions of americans being murdered in the flash of an eye “now everything im saying the republican leadership has said over and over again and yet republican leadership refuses to enforce the terms of the iran review legislation – federal law that the administration is defying by not handing the entire deal over i have laid out a clear path a detailed path that leadership can follow to stop this deal leadership refuses to do so instead we had a show vote that was designed to lose and it did exactly what we expected the democrats by and large put party loyalty above the national security of this country above standing with israel above protecting the lives of millions of americans if we really believed what so many of us have said that this poses the risk of murdering millions of americans is there any higher priority the most powerful constitutional tool congress has is the power of the purse if we had the ability to stop this deal and we don’t and millions of americans die how do we explain that to the men and women who elected us look im not advocating that we fight willynilly im advocating that we fight on things that matter “dont give million to planned parenthood a corrupt organization that is taking the lives of vast numbers of unborn children and selling their body parts in a criminal conspiracy directly contrary to federal law and dont give billion to the ayatollah khamenei who seeks to murder millions in both instances those are defending life and yet republican leadership is not willing to lift a finger if only all the people who might be murdered by a nuclear weapon could create a pac in washington and hire some lobbyists maybe leadership would listen to them then but the truck driver at home the waitress at home the school teacher at home the pastor the police officer the working men and women the washington cartel doesnt listen to them “and ill note where this deal is headed in december when this dirty continuing resolution expires leadership is already foreshadowing they plan to bust the budget caps why we talked about it at the beginning barack obama has discovered he says the word ‘shutdown’ and republican leadership screams surrenders and runs to the hills so obama understanding that quite well says ‘if you dont bust the budget caps ill shut the government down’ and republicans in this bizarre process republican leadership will blame whatever obama does on other republicans you noticed how much energy leader mcconnell devotes to attacking conservatives you notice how much energy speaker boehner develops to attacking conservatives “just yesterday the speaker of the house went on national television and on national television he directed an obscene epithet at me personally hes welcome to insult whomever he likes i dont intend to reciprocate but when has leadership ever showed that level of venom that level of animosity to president obama and the democrats who are bankrupting this country who are destroying the constitution who are endangering the future of our children and grandchildren who are retreating from leadership in the world and have created an environment that has led to the rise of radical islamic terrorism “you know one of the dynamics mr president weve seen in fight after fight is harry reid and the democrats sit back and laugh why because its republican leadership that leads the onslaught attacking conservatives saying ‘no you can’t and we wont do anything to stop obamacare no you cant and we wont do anything to stop planned parenthood no you cant and we wont do anything to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons’ if republican leadership really believes we can accomplish nothing then why does it matter if you have a republican house or senate every two years come october november we tell the voters it matters intensely to paraphrase the immortal words of hillary clinton ‘what difference does it make’ if the standard for republican leadership is anything that gets votes well support that means harry reid and nancy pelosi remain the de facto leaders in the senate and the house “and i would note by the way if in december leadership goes through with their promise or –not promise—but suggestion to bust the budget caps they will have done something astonishing historically the three legs of the conservative stool have been fiscal conservatives social conservatives national security conservatives between planned parenthood iran and the budget caps leadership will have managed to abandon all three no wonder the american people are frustrated no wonder the american people do not understand why leadership isnt listening to them “i ask unanimous consent that my time be extended…the democrats are objecting to my speaking further and both the democrats and republican leadership are objecting to the american people speaking further i yield the floor”washington dc – us sen ted cruz rtexas today spoke at the stop the iran deal rally hosted and organized by tea party patriots leading efforts to halt the iran nuclear deal sen cruz underscored the dangers of iran acquiring nuclear weapons which would be funded and accelerated by this catastrophic deal “when we talk about terrorism it’s worth remembering that if this deal goes through we know to an absolute certainty people will die americans will die israelis will die europeans will die osama bin laden never had billion he was filled with bilious hatred and using rudimentary tools murdered nearly americans on september we’re now talking about giving the ayatollah khameneia theocratic homicidal maniac who hates america every bit as much as bin laden didgiving him billion to carry out his murderous plans” sen cruz said “i want to ask every senate democrat how will you look in the eyes of every mother or father or sons or daughters of those who are murdered by jihadists those americans who are blown up those americans who are shot those americans who are killed those israelis who are murdered and let me be clear if you vote to send billions of dollars to jihadists who have pledged to murder americans then you bear direct responsibility for the murders carried out with the dollars you have given them you cannot wash your hands of that blood” sen cruz’s speech can be read in its entirety below and video can be viewed here “god bless the united states of america what an incredible gathering here today i want to speak to three groups of people “i want to start by speaking to the american people this iran nuclear deal is catastrophic it is the single greatest national security threat facing america if it goes through there will be three consequences “number one the obama administration will become quite literally the worlds leading financier of radical islamic terrorism if it goes through over billion dollars will flow directly to iran to the ayatollah khamenei and billions of those dollars will go directly to hamas to hezbollah to the houthis to radical islamic terrorists across the world and those jihadists will use those dollars to murder americans to murder israelis to murder europeans “the second consequence of this deal is that it abandons four american hostages in an iranian hellhole including pastor said abedini an american citizen a christian pastor sentenced to eight years in prison for the crime of preaching the gospel including former marine amir hekmati including washington post reporter jason rezaian and including bob levinson it is a disgrace for this administration to abandon americans in iranian hellholes “but the third consequence of this deal going through if it does is that it will facilitate and accelerate the nation of iran acquiring nuclear weapons there is no greater threat to the safety and security of america there is no greater threat to the safety and security of israel than a nuclear iran i agree with prime minister netanyahu that a nuclear iran poses an existential threat to the nation of israel and let me be clear when he says existential he doesnt mean a bunch of frenchmen in black berets chainsmoking he means literally going to the very existence of israel “when prime minister netanyahu addressed a joint session of congress a joint session that president obama boycotted that vice president biden boycotted that every member of the cabinet boycotted i participated in a panel with elie wiesel the nobel laureate the holocaust survivor and elie wiesel observed the one threat on the face of the earth capable of murdering million jews in an instant in a flash of light is a nuclear iran elie wiesel observed never again means never again “the second group i want to address are democratic senators and democratic members of congress right now today senate democrats have come out in support of this deal it is my hope and prayer that every one of those senate democrats reconsiders that they go home and they fall to their knees and they pray tonight i agree with former democratic senator joe lieberman that this vote is quite likely the most important vote that any member of congress any member of the senate will cast in their entire career “there was a time when there was a tradition of scoop jackson democrats of jfk democrats of joe lieberman democrats of democrats who were willing to defend national security sadly that is becoming rarer and rarer in todays congress so to every democratic senator they are facing a choice do you value the safety and security of the united states of america do you value standing with our friend and ally the nation of israel do you value the lives of millions of americans or do you value more party loyalty to the obama white house to every democratic senator whos said he or she will support this deal i ask you to consider how will you look in the eyes of the mothers and fathers of our soldiers the hundreds of soldiers american soldiers who were murdered in iraq with iranian ieds that came from general soleimani this deal lifts sanctions on general soleimani tell me if youre a democratic senator how you look a mom in the eye and say i voted to lift sanctions on the man who murdered your son when he was defending this nation “but beyond that when we talk about terrorism its worth remembering that if this deal goes through we know to an absolute certainty people will die americans will die israelis will die europeans will die osama bin laden never had billion he was filled with bilious hatred and using rudimentary tools murdered nearly americans on september we’re now talking about giving the ayatollah khameneia theocratic homicidal maniac who hates america every bit as much as bin laden didgiving him billion to carry out his murderous plans “i want to ask every senate democrat how will you look in the eyes of every mother or father or sons or daughters of those who are murdered by jihadists those americans who are blown up those americans who are shot those americans who are killed those israelis who are murdered and let me be clear if you vote to send billions of dollars to jihadists who have pledged to murder americans then you bear direct responsibility for the murders carried out with the dollars you have given them you cannot wash your hands of that blood “and let me say to republican leadership well hold on i come not to bury caesar but to praise him i want to give a path forward there are two men in washington dc who can defeat this deal their names are majority leader mitch mcconnell and speaker john boehner under the terms of the corkercardin review legislation the clock does not begin ticking until the president hands over the entire deal and he has not handed over the side agreements what that means is that all that has to happen is for mitch mcconnell and john boehner to say the congressional review period has not started under federal law it is illegal for obama to lift sanctions “now this is a lawless president so the odds are significant even if congress did that this president would ignore the law and try to lift sanctions but i want in particular to speak to the ceo and the board of director and general counsel of every financial institution every bank that is holding frozen iranian money if this president behaves illegally and decrees you can hand that money over to iran that does not exempt you from the legal obligation to follow the law and any bank that listens to this president and releases billions to an international terrorist like the ayatollah khamenei will face billions of dollars in civil liability and litigation and there will come a president who is not named barack obama “mitch mcconnell and john boehner can stop this deal if they simply enforce if they simply enforce federal law “if iran gets a nuclear weapon the single greatest risk is they would take that nuclear weapon they would put it on a ship anywhere in the atlantic and they would fire it up straight into the air into the atmosphere they would set off whats called an emp an electromagnetic pulse it would take down the electrical grid on the entire eastern seaboard and kill tens of millions of americans “we can stop that but if senate democrats decide that party loyalty matters more than national security and if republican leadership decides that a showvote is more important than stopping this deal then the single most important issue in will be stopping iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon “and any commanderinchief worthy of defending this nation should be prepared to stand up on january and rip to shreds this catastrophic deal any commanderinchief worthy of defending this nation should be prepared in january to look in the eyes of the ayatollah khamenei and say under no circumstances does iran led by a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to america under no circumstances will iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons and if iran will not stop its nuclear program we will stop it for you “i want to thank everyone here for this rally i want to thank the tea party patriots i want to thank the proisrael groups the national security groups i want to thank my friend donald trump for joining us today i want to thank the leaders of congress who are here and i want to thank the american people “lets rise up and tell every elected official in washington no more talk no more show votes get it done stop this deal “thank you and god bless you”wow! god bless the value voters summit so i’ve got to ask what are these things is barack obama coming let me say thank you to my friend jim bridenstine what an incredible powerful fighting conservative you know there’s an ancient chinese curse may you live in interesting times these are interesting times yesterday pope francis was in washington wonderful to welcome him here i have to say the press conference was a little awkward because every time the reporters addressed a question to your holiness barack obama answered well and then today the president of china president xi is in town media all across the world are reporting on this historic meeting of the world’s most powerful communist and the president of china how many of you all have watched the republican debates how fantastic is it that we have such an array of young charismatic talented principled leaders stepping forward to lead this party and to lead this country and what a contrast — — with the democrats you know i’m pretty sure the first democratic debate is going to consist of hillary clinton and the chipotle clerk and you know it is amazing to watch the democrats as they keep moving their debates first it was going to be august then it was september then it was october they may just move it to you know in a few months we may see the first presidential debate held at leavenworth you know if they can put — project a rainbow on the white house maybe they can put bars on the windows and i’ll tell you they did actually plan — you know this is not widely known — but they had planned to have an earlier democratic debate the problem was the debate invitation was emailed to hillary i am so honored to be back with so many friends today i want to say my friend tony perkins the family research council does incredible work in this country you want to talk about a strong principled conservative who scares the living daylights out of washington but i have to tell you tony doesn’t scare washington nearly as much as the men and women gathered in this ballroom do you want to know how much each of you terrify washington yesterday john boehner was speaker of the house y’all come to town and somehow that changes my own request is can you come more often tony we need to schedule these weekly — once a week listen every one of us — we know that our country’s in crisis we know that this is not a typical time in politics we’re bankrupting our kids and grandkids our constitutional rights are under assault each and every day from washington and america has receded from leadership in the world it is making the world a much more dangerous place but i want to come to you this morning with a word of hope and encouragement and exhortation all across this country this american people are waking up and i’ll tell you today help is on the way so i want to ask everyone here to look forward — look forward to january if i am elected president let me tell you what i intend to do on the first day in office the first thing i intend to do is rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action the president tell us he’s got a phone and he’s got a pen well you live by the pen you die by the pen and my pen has got an eraser but sadly the corruption’s not been limited to the white house it has extended across every agency of the federal government and the second thing i intend to do on my first day in office is instruct the department of justice to open an investigation into planned parenthood and these horrible videos and to prosecute any and all criminal conduct by that organization the administration of justice should be blind to party of ideology the only fidelity of the department of justice should be to the laws and the constitution of the united states of america the third thing i intend to do on the first day in office is instruct the department of justice and the irs and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today that means that every service man and woman can worship the lord god almighty with all of his heart mind and soul and his commanding officer has nothing to say about it that means the little sisters of the poor who pope francis visited this week will find that the case against them has been dismissed you know kim davis is here just a couple of weeks ago i had the opportunity to visit kim in a kentucky jailhouse now six months a year ago if i had come and said that a christian woman was going to be thrown in jail locked up in jail for living her faith the media would have dismissed me as a nutcase that’s where we are today and i’ll tell you kim and i we embraced and i told her i said kim thank you i said kim you are inspiring millions across this country by standing for your faith you know the book of acts tells us that when paul and silas were in jail that god brought an earthquake and broke open the jail cell and what i told kim is i said you are being lifted up in prayer by millions of believers across america and across the world you may have thought you were alone in that jail cell you didn’t understand how crowded it was and i’ll tell you kim’s very simple response she smiled she pointed out and she said to god be the glory the fourth thing i intend to do on the first day in office is rip to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal the single greatest national security threat facing america is the threat of a nuclear iran i got to tell you i can’t wait to stand on a debate stage next to hillary clinton — — and to make very clear to the american people if you vote for hillary you are voting for iran to acquire nuclear weapons and if you vote for me under no circumstance will a nation led by a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to america under no circumstances will iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons and if the ayatollah doesn’t understand that we may have to help introduce him to his virgins the fifth thing i intend to do the first day in office is begin the process of moving the american embassy in israel to jerusalem the once and eternal capital of israel that’s day one there are days in a year four years in a presidential term and four years in a second term by the end of eight years this ballroom is going to be a whole lot bigger and by the end of eight years there are going to be a whole lot of reporters and newspaper editors and journalists who’ve checked themselves into therapy in the days that follow i will go to congress and we will repeal every word of obamacare in the days that follow i will instruct the federal department of education which should be abolished — — i will instruct the federal department of education that common core ends today in the days that follow we will rebuild our military we will honor the commitments made to our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and we will protect our servicemen and women’s constitutional right to keep and bear arms and defend themselves that means the next time a jihadist walks into a recruiting center in chattanooga tennessee he’s going to encounter the business end of firearms wielded by a dozen marines in the days that follow we will finally finally finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities we will stop the indefensible practice of releasing violent criminal illegal aliens and we will pass kate’s law in the days that follow we will take on the epa — — and the cfpb and the alphabet soup of government agencies that strangle small businesses and we will unleash booming economic growth in the days that follow i will go to congress and we will pass fundamental tax reform we will pass a simple flat tax — — where every american can fill out his or her taxes on a postcard and when we do that we should abolish the irs now some of you all may be thinking all of that makes sense to me it’s basic common sense live within your means don’t bankrupt our kids and grandkids follow the constitution but can we do it can it be done you know scripture tells us there’s nothing new under the sun i think where we are today is very very much like the late s — same failed economic policies same misery stagnation and malaise the same feckless and naïve foreign policy in fact the exact same countries — russia and iran — openly laughing at and mocking the president of the united states now why is it that that analogy gives me so much hope and optimism because we know how that story ended all across this country millions of men and women rose up and became the reagan revolution and it didn’t come from washington washington despised ronald reagan by the way if you see a candidate who washington embraces run and hide it turned this country around and i’m here to tell you the same thing is happening again all over this country millions of men and women are waking up do you know since this campaign has started out of republican candidates do you know which campaign raised the most hard money we did to date over contributions people all over the country coming to tedcruzorg ted cruzorg tedcruzorg the people are waking up and let me tell you what washington wants washington wants us divided washington wants conservatives splintered they want a chunk of evangelicals over here a chunk of conservatives over here a chunk of libertarians over here a chunk of tea party folks over here that’s how if we are splintered that a moderate establishment candidate runs up the middle with percent of the vote steals the nomination and then loses to hillary clinton in the general election you know what we’ve seen that movie before i’m not interested in going to see rocky we have a simple task before us if conservatives unite we win so i’m here to ask each and every one of you stand stand in your faith stand with your principles come together how do we turn this country around just like in we rise up as we the people and we say we will defend this last best hope for mankind this shining city on a hill that is the united states of america thank you and god bless you
